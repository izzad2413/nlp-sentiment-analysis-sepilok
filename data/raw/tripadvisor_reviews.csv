We went to the orangutan first  feeding (suggested by our driver) and later to the sun bear sanctuary which is just next to the orangutan. Both are well maintained with a very helpfull and kind staff. Facilty such as locker room and toilet are fantastic except the cafe is yet to be open.  At 1.30 the same day we went to Proboscis Monkey Sanctuary whic is about 40 minutes drive from Sepulok. It was very nice to have seen the monkey from a short distance. As suggested by our driver, we went to see fireflies which is not in our plan. We were so thankfull to him for this experience. The next day we went to the turtle Island and spend overnight.Prior to arrival to Sandakan, I contacted a driver, Mr. Eddie via whatsapp (00601171171178) and email: borneowildnature@gmail.com who piick us up at the airport and took us to one of the hotel in Sepilok. He seems to have received many good comment and recomendations in Tripadvisor. Experience, helpfull, funny and soft spoken gentleman."
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 22 May 2023,Friends,I really enjoyed visiting the sepilok orangutang centre. It was beautiful to see the orangutangs in the nursery section. The staff are doing an amazing job rehabilitating these youngsters. For the morning feeding session on the platform no orangutangs came so we returned in the afternoon and were privileged to see 2 individual mothers with their babies and another youngster. It was a beautiful sight to witness. These are wild animals so there is never a guarantee to see them at the outdoor platform. 
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 13 May 2023,Couples,"It‚Äôs important to know that visiting the Sepilok orphanage isn‚Äôt the only place that you can see Orangutans in Borneo. Prior to travelling to Borneo I think I thought this would be the only time we would see them. We had a wonderful visit from 2 orangutans to our lodge (My Nature Resort) the night before our visit to Sepilok. We also saw orangutans at each of the three other lodges we stayed at. Whilst there is no doubt that there they are plenty of Orangutans at the sanctuary and sightings are pretty much guaranteed it now feels that some of our best sightings on the trip were the truly wild ones. The sanctuary is busy with tourists but is well organised. We didn‚Äôt see the welcome talk , not sure why but our guide gave us some background. Definitely worth a visit but it wasn‚Äôt our holiday highlight. Don‚Äôt take any large bags with you or small ones as these need to be left in lockers at the entrance. Go in well hydrated if it‚Äôs a hot day as you can‚Äôt take your water in with you and some guests were leaving the feeding early to get back to their vehicles for water."

I enjoyed watching endangered animals roam freely in their natural habitat, including observing a feeding session at the Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Center, seeing Sun Bear and visit Proboscis Monkey Sanctuary. The park was well maintained and clean. Public toilet is available and very comfortableüëçWe planned to spend only two nights in Sandakan, I contacted a private driver (Mr. Eddie) in advance to let him know the places I wanted to see and he pre-scheduled the appropriate tour content to ensure it will suit our timing. After the trip to Sepilok and the monkeys sanctuary we were taken to Sandakan town, food markets, and buffet lunches where only locals come. On the second day, Eddie pick us up from hotel at 12.30 pm and start our trip to Kinabatangan River for afternoon cruise. Boat cruise start at 4.00 pm sharp. Surprisingly and not to our expectation we saw a group of elephants  swimming cross the river. Proboscis monkey and other type of the monkeys, hornbil birds can also be seen along the river. We reached back our hotel around 8.30 pm. It was a long ride but surely a worth trip.The next morning Eddie toook us to the airport. We were able to experience things that we would not have been able to experience with other driver. Thanks to his careful guidance. The car he used is very new and clean. He told us he has a four wheel truck and a 6 seater Toyota Land Cruiser for bigger group.. And we know for sure he charged us way below the other driver who we contacted earlier. He can speak a very good English as he graduated from a well known university in Malaysia and worked in bank  before his retirement. We would definitely recommend him!This is his contact information:+60 117 117 1178borneowildnature@gmail.com"
1.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 3 May 2023,,Had a really disappointing visit here - it had been one of the things we‚Äôd been most looking forward to on our trip to Borneo from the UK. We arrived at 2.45 for the 3pm feeding - but avoid this if you can if you want to enjoy your visit as the staff are really pushy and started hassling us to leave from about 3.45. Walked down the boardwalk back to the car at 3.50 with 5 members of staff following us step by step about 30cm behind which was no fun. We walked past an orangutan on the boardwalk and stopped when we were about 10m past him to let my 3-year-old take a look - and one of the staff actually physically pushed me with my son on my shoulders on the boardwalk because he said it was too late. Left with my son in tears. Such a shame as we‚Äôd come a long way to visit.

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 24 April 2023,Friends,"Sipilok was a great experience. We were able to see many orangutans in more natural settings. The caretakers call out when the food is set out and the orangutans responds, coming down from trees or across the land. We were very fortunate to see an alpha male who seemed to be ""in charge"". The other orangutans seemed to let him eat first and kind of snuck around to get their share. Watched mom with baby coming down from tress and taking her food back up. Lots of viewing spots and can get some amazing photos. This is a special place in my view because they protect the animals while allowing them to live in their natural habitat. Wonderful experience. I feel so fortunate to have seen them. Saw gorillas in Rwanda and this was as exciting."
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 21 April 2023,Family,"We had a fantastic experience here. If you are not on a time-limited tour be sure to go back for multiple feeding times as each will be a different experience. Be alert as we also encountered orangutans on the walkway, in the tree above the restrooms and along the path to the sun bears (we heard the sun bear centre was filled with orangutans the following day).While the main feeding time is widely listed as 10, there is an earlier one at the nursery, so 9 is a better time to arrive. Just be aware that the cafe mentioned as being at the site may not be open. It was closed on the days we visited and appeared to have been for some time. (I got the impression some families with young children had been counting on it). Unrefridgerated water is available for sale at the ticket office, but if you need to buy some, do so at the start, as the ticket office closes after the main entry times ahead of feedings. Also there is an extra (very small) ticket charge for any camera bigger than a mobile phone."

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 12 April 2023,Couples,"A great experience, such incredible work helping these Orangutans relearn their lost skills and eventually make it back to the wild. Meanwhile offering the security of a regular meal if needed since sadly, due to the diminishing natural jungle in Sabah, sometimes food is scarce. I would recommend watching the introduction video before entering the sanctuary, as it explains a lot of how and why they do what they do, and increased the level of appreciation and understanding we got from the experience. And made what we did experience even more incredible. My wife and I went on two separate days and were extremely lucky on both occasions. On the first, at the feeding we saw 7 Orangutans, including a juvenile, an adult male with the large cheeks and a mother with a wild born baby. We also went to the nursery feeding with all those Orangutans too young or only recently rescued. That was an equally special experience and we saw many Orangutans of all ages. On the second visit we saw two Orangutans at the feeding, which was just as incredible as we got to watch the pair interact with one another. We also saw another large Orangutan watching from atop a large tree in the distance, as well as a number of hornbills and macaques. I would recommend bringing a pair of binoculars if you own some. "

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 26 March 2023,Couples,"If you need a private hire car and driver and avoid using rip-off tour operators, just WhatsApp Anzar on +60 178217605.  He speaks great English, is polite and importantly is a safe driver,  His vehicle will take luggage if you need collecting from the airport.  We used Anzar to go to Orang Utan Sanctuary, Proboscis Monkeys, Kinabantangan River and to take us to the jetty for Turtle Island.  Don‚Äôt use a tour operator as he will take you to these places and you book tickets direct.  For example an all day ticket to Orang Utan (tours often don‚Äôt tell you ticket is valid for both feeding sessions and that is important because if the Macac monkeys turn up the Orang Utan likely won‚Äôt and we saw not much on the morning due to the Macacs, but loads of Orang Utan in the afternoon) is MYR35 or ¬£6 and some operators are charging ¬£70 just because they pick you up.  Turtle Island booked direct (I have given Anzar the details) is also 50% cheaper than a tour operator.  He is not working on commission, but charges for his driving costs.  When not doing this, he acts as a Grab Taxi."
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 13 February 2023,,"This is one of the must-see attractions in Sepilok. It is almost guaranteed to see an orangutan here, but it is still good to remember that this is not a zoo and orangutans are roaming freely. When we visited the place, we saw just one orangutan with a baby on the first feeding and three on the second one. The ticket is valid for the whole day so if you stay in the area, you can watch both feedings.The place itself is relatively simple. It is just a boardwalk with single feeding platform. Then again, that is all you need. Feeding platform can get relatively crowded during feeding times. If you stay in the area, it is best to arrive 30-45 minutes before the feeding time to enjoy some quiet time.When we were there, wearing a mask was mandatory to protect the orangutans. Also, no bags are allowed and they must be left in the guarded storage room."

After a short walkway, you'll reach the feeding platform. Don't forget to look up as you walk as there are several wild orang utan around.  Get there early, we went earlier to watch orang utan playing around the feeding platform.  When the food comes, the monkeys appear from all directions. Well worth the visit."

We hired a private driver anzar +60 17-821 7605 on what's app. He was fantastic he took us to the Proboscis monkeys and Sunbears as well. Very reliable. Please remember this is a wild sanctuary and you are not guaranteed to see any orangs. If none come for feeding it means they are doing a great job.Your ticket is valid for both morning and afternoon feedings.The baby area was under Reno when we visited which was a shame, but still worth the trip"

We arrived at 9+ am, viewed the display area and watched an orang utan video before venturing to the platform in wait of the orang utans. Did you know that the orang utans are given the same food everyday so that they get bored and would forage for themselves? A few orang utans appeared fortunately. It was a privilege to see them."

People downgrading the reviews because ‚Äúthere‚Äôs not much to see‚Äù are utter morons!!!This is not a zoo, the chance of seeing these amazing animals here is just that, a chance and you pay a very reasonable price to visit and support this incredibly important project. We stayed nearby for 2 nights before joining a tour and visited a few times so this is a really good idea if you want to maximise your chances. The first afternoon session we arrived early and were very lucky to see a number of orang-utans including a mother with a tiny baby. The animals are wild! Yes is a sanctuary but the platform you can observe has no fences so they may be there, they may not. So might other wild grey monkeys! Obviously chances are higher outside of the main fruit season when the monkeys need a supplement to their diet. Please be mindful of your surroundings and respect the quiet they deserve while eating. Bags are not allowed so lockers are available, large cameras are charged an extra fee but phones are ok. If I see one more person FaceTiming someone on full volume at one of these places I might scream, you people are so inconsiderate, one staff member was reminding people to be quiet but I think they could impress this a little more firmly. All in all I would not have missed this - go without expectations and enjoy!"
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 26 December 2022,Friends,"So lucky to encounter a giant orang utan , 29yo. Even the center worker from other area will come to see if they know a giant one turns up. Is a luck thing. Apparently they can live up to our human age. They live in the wild and can chose to come whenever. If they managed to find food in the deeper part of the jungle , then they won‚Äôt come. That giant OU apparently is super strong. Was told that it will take 3 body builders to restrain it.  Was told is a she because baby OU hangs around close to her. Her hand palms reminds me of gorilla palms.Only one platform is opened. Their bridge was affected by falling tree trunks and so they have closed the second platform and nursery section. I was hoping to buy mineral water but cant find any.. miss drinking sparkling mineral water cause it was quite hot. The local stalls were only selling sugary drinks. So please bring your own water. Also at car entrance, there is a teenage dog looking like a horse in white who is under nourish and hungry. Super skinny too. I bought the fried fish cake from local stall to feed him. Kindly bring a bag of kibbles or better still any leftover rice meal to feed this skinny dog and his friend. Stay kind."

The helpers here are so dedicated to their well-being. Unfortunately the only downside was the video kept stalling. It‚Äôs an important part of the tour and we felt it was a valid and important part of the trip.
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 30 November 2022,,"Fantastic visit to see both the orangutans as well as nearby sun bears. While the bears were kind of shy and we didn't see them a great deal, we did see three. The orangutans were amazing. Saw an alpha male and got to watch them close up and see their behaviour and the response of others deferring to the alpha male. Quite an experience. The staff were impressive both in their care of the animals and in their knowledge of them. Definitely a highlight of the trip. I had been to Ruanda to see gorillas and was excited to see orangutans."
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 19 November 2022,,"Great opportunity to learn about orangutans in Malaysia and to see them up close.  As there are no orangutans in the wild on peninsular Malaysia, this centre has been created to educate locals and visitors where they are more likely to reach more people and therefore to be able to raise more donations (understandable). They stated animals are released on Borneo when they are old enough and if they have adequate life skills. Enclosures seemed adequate/relatively natural, our guide was knowledgeable, and animals seemed to have some privacy. Time at centre is limited by boat schedule, but provided reasonable amount of time."

4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 26 October 2022,,"Really enjoyed our visits to the sanctuary. Saw many orangutans of all sizes,   including the dominate male! It was such a treat to see this enormous guy. We  revisited in the afternoon and it was not as crowded with tourists as the morning session. Maybe less tourist noise in the afternoon meant the orangutans were more comfortable coming out onto the feeding platform?The security/rangers did a good job keeping tourists away from the orangutans that inevitably find their way onto the walkways.The glassed rehabilitation area allows for comfortable viewing of the young/invalid orangutans. Don‚Äôt let the glass put you off as the feeding platform (which follows the glassed nursery viewing) is really great. Get there early for good position.Lots of monkeys cashing in on a free feed, but they know the orangutans are boss and keep a respectful eye on them!Encouraging to see such a healthy looking jungle around the feeding platform. The surrounding jungle is apparently is quite vast in size.We heard a Pygmy Elephant as we were leaving, but tourists do not get to see them."

You cannot take a bag large or small in. No food or drink inc water can be taken to the feeding station. Locker storage is provided free.The nursery is currently closed which was disappointing due to maintenance, but these things happen.We visited 5 times over 4 days. I would suggest afternoon visits are better. Not so busy as less tour groups and we saw far more Orangutans in the afternoon. Each day we visited we were incredibly lucky. Seeing Mum's with babies clinging to them and individual Orangutans. On 2 visits we were graced by the presence of the Alpha Male. He is huge! Apparently he generally visits every 3 weeks or so!The staff at the centre are informative and friendly. They take the safety of the visitors seriously but also the welfare of the Orangutans is just as high a priority.Can't recommend highly enough if you want to see wild Orangutans "
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 27 September 2022,Friends,"I visited the center twice and both times offered great views of Orangutan and a lot of them came down for feeding.The center offers two feeding/viewing times and have both an outdoor area for adults and behind glass area for young and adolescent orangutan. The primates come down from the ropes and play, whilst also come down the feeding platform too. You‚Äôll also see macaque monkeys there too. It was very hot at the center, so be prepared. Highly recommend to visit."

It was even better than expected, especially because we saw the largest alpha male who was huge!    They have an excellent set up for viewing without being too close and the staff were good at moving visitors if an orangutans decided walking on the decking was easier than the ground.   We went 4 times and loved it each time."

On my first visit 16 years ago, I only saw 2 orangutan and found the trip disappointing. On this recent trip , I saw 9 orangutan during the feeding session. I was going to leave, feeling a little more satisfied and then the staff pointed me to the nursery which I wasn't aware of the first time. The walk there has some awe-inspiring very high trees. At the nursery,  you sit indoors and watch 8 orangutan through a glass playing and monkeying around. So this was an amazing trip."

A pretty full on day in the heat but worth it.  Thanks Anzar - it was a great day.We got here around 9am for opening, pretty cheap to get (something like ¬£10 for 2 adults and a child) but then had to wait for an hour until feeding time.  We only saw one macaque in that hour.  Feeding time came and two orang utans came and ate followed by another macaque - our guide said it‚Äôs normal to see 2 or 3 orang utans which felt pretty disappointing tbh.  It was mostly shaded but still v hot at that time.   Lots of people seemed to pay for guides inside the facility which seemed a waste of time to me unless you want to know about trees.  There were plenty of staff around to answer questions.Main thing though is it‚Äôs my understanding you‚Äôre not going to see a load of orang utans and a couple is about the expectation.What was really interesting was that later in the day we went to the sun bear place across the road and saw an orang utan lolling about in the tree right above our path - 2m away.  We had lunch at Banana Cafe and while eating another orang was feeding in a tree just above the walkway.  It was more special seeing them as a surprise in their natural habitat rather than seeing a couple down specifically for the food provided.  It was all luck of course that we saw them at the other places."

Depending on the time you visit, you may see the youngsters being fed. You are able to watch them from two indoor viewing platforms. There is also an outdoor feeding station which is stocked at 10am. No orangutans showed up the day we were there (although some macaques turned up to raid the supplies!) which shows that the orangutans who are living independently in the area are not in need of the food on offer. That‚Äôs a positive but obviously a bit disappointing for the tourists!"

There are 2 feeding times, 10am and 3pm, the 10am one is rammed with bus tours and can get busy, the 3pm feeding was very quiet with only about 20 people there. If you do attend be patient, the monkeys put the orangutan off feeding but they do eventually turn up. Well worth a visit.

Expect crowds, expect to hear people speaking to each other while you are trying to enjoy the sounds of the wild, but expect to see many orang-utans in all shapes and sizes. We watched feeding time and was able to secure a good vantage point by arriving 30 minutes before feeding. Trying to forget that these animals are fed by man, we were able to get amazing shots. One had to pay 10RMB per camera (phones included) and RMB1000 for any lens greater than 400mm. The animals are too close anyway to use such a powerful lens!The nursery was underwhelming.All in all a great must-do trip."
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 20 July 2022,Solo,"This is a great rehabilitation centre where you can get very close to the orangutans, who are free to roam around the forest. Feeding times are at 10am and 3pm, and you are advised to arrive at least 15min before (or 30min to avoid the queues). The centre is closed for a short period during the day and for the day at 4pm. Tickets cost MYR30 for non-Malaysians (MYR5 for Malaysians or residents), and they can be used for the whole day. If you have a camera (mobile phones excluded) you will be charged MYR10. No bags or water bottles are allowed in due to a huge group of Macaque monkeys that also frequent the place, so you will need to store them away in the lockers outside the entrance, which is free . The feeding times are not to be missed as the orangutans swing down from the trees and gather on a platform very close to the audience. The nursery further back houses more younger orangutans and mothers with their babies. The guards are very helpful and diligent in keeping everyone safe should orangutans come on to the walking bridge. All workers there do a great job of making sure there are minimal contact with humans.There is a Bornean Sun Bear reserve just next door, with a much more well stocked gift shop. I would recommend the Sepilok Nature Resort or Sepilok Jungle Resort to stay. The Nature Resort has amazing food with local and western options (best I‚Äôve had during my two weeks in Sabah) also with great views, so I would highly recommend having dinner there.Sepilok is a 30min drive from Sandakan airport. I have seen people say arrive 1.5 hours before but my flight was in the early morning and baggage drop/security only took 15min. You are only able to get taxis from the nearby hotels from 6am (using Grab app or book at hotel). I booked one for 5:30am but it did not arrive. Overall it was a brilliant experience, I went to see the orangutans three times and each time was unique and memorable. This is a must do if you are in Sabah."

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 4 July 2022,Couples,Arrived on a very hot morning and told to leave everything but our cameras in a locker or the car. Would have liked to have taken a bottle of water with us.We watched a video about the work of the centre and the orangutans and then went to the feeding platform.  A mother and baby and a young orangutan were waiting in the trees for feeding time but a large male appeared and the mother and baby quickly left. The youngster waited patiently while the adult male  ate and then bravely joined in.  A few macacs were loitering waiting for the  male to leave.Next was the boardwalk walk to see the young orangutans being prepared for release in the wild.  We watched them play and have their breakfast and that was about it.  The visit was over in a couple of hours.This was our main reason for visiting Borneo and it seemed a lot smaller than we had expected. Still glad we went as next door is the Sun Bear Conservation Centre so two visits in one 
3.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 26 June 2022,,"Was a bit disappointed, but the organisation does a great job and such rehabilitation centres are important. Just, apart from the nursery and the feeding platform, you have limited options to walk around in the jungle. You are not allowed to take anything with you (not even drinking water), for the camera (depending on the size) you have to pay an extra-fee and can only bring one lens. So, without water and not much opportunities to walk around, it is more a short visit during feeding hour and then back. Also missed a bit information from the ranger, that bring the food to the platform, where then the crowd of tourists is waiting in front of it. A few words about the centre, the number of Orang Utans there, the work they do etc. There is a visitors centre, but not many people go there. Therefore to make the work of the centre more known, success stories, funding etc., I recommend, to say a few word to the guests, before they start the feeding.

We could barely leave the nursery because watching them play was all consuming.

This was a really good experience, having been fortunate enough to see Orangutans in the wild in the week before to be able to get up close and see an orgtan at the eedng station and then walkig along the boardwalk literally metres in front of us was a truly incredible experience. There was a bit of an issue with them counting my gopro and camera as professional equipment (It was a bridge camera so was technically not in the remit) and so i got charged fairly heavily. Other than that though everything was great.The orphanage was great too seeing two Orangutans playing amongst themselves included some comedy gold.Definately worth making the trip!"

The orangs were free to wonder around the forest and visitors were clearly told not to interact with them and keep clear when they cross paths which I was very pleased with as too many times do you see animals being used to impress tourists at the animals expense. Feeding time was done from a distance safe for the orangs but visitors got a spectactular view! You are able to buy items which help to fundraise for the Orangs and there is so much information available to visitors on the animals. If you can I would recommend that you sponsor an Orang as they really benefit from this and we were sent a little pack to the UK which was a very nice surprise after our return from our trip.The Bornean Sunbear sancturary is next door to this also so I would also recommend visiting both of these centres.

Such a nice peaceful time to be there. We visited on the morning arriving around 9am and wondered along the board walk spotting 2 utans almost immediately.  We spent the hour until the feeding session casually watching 4 Orangutans hang around the trees and play, only around 20 people there and so nice not trying to jostle for viewing positions as I imagine it will be during peak pre covid season. It was an unbelievable up close view of these spectacular animals! They unfortunately do seem to be trained somewhat listening to the commands of the guides making the experience a little less authentic but was very pleased with this situation as we were leaving a big female was swinging along side us and the guide made sure we were safe to continue walking. We returned in the afternoon after visiting the sunbears and was a little more disappointed as many local families had arrived with crying children and cellphones ringing on loud. We very lucky spotted a mother and her baby over by the sun bear sanctuary she was absolutely beautiful and so nice to see her just going about her business away from the sanctuary.

Great place and motives  - fully supportive of the project, but we were unfortunate and only saw two female orangutans. The majority we saw were younger orangutans in the ""nursery"" area. Perhaps it all felt too artificial for us (zoo like) which is not what we were expecting. Don't get me wrong, there were no cages etc like a zoo, and they could wander freely, but just not quite what we were expecting, hence the score.Any larger males are moved out the area, so they do not make this their territory and scare off other orangutans, which makes sense, but again disappointing on ones expectations."

The feeding of the elders is done on a platform in the jungle about 30 meters from a boardwalk & viewing platform.

Some of the adults are really cheeky and come very close.  We watched a video first and listened to an entertaining talk by Casey who was great and knew all the orangutans names.  So good to see his enthusiasm and passion to help this endangered species.  The keepers are brilliant too - always keeping an eye on things.  The young orangutans are hilarious to watch.  I could have sat and watched them for hours.  The centre is very well run and the staff are obviously dedicated.  Highly recommended.

It was an encounter that was only a few feet away from us - no fences or barriers. You can spot them in the trees as you explore the forest.There is an orangutan playground which you can view from behind a glass screen.

Later on, once they had dispersed, a tribe of Macaques arrived and cleared any remaining leftovers.From there, we visited the nursery and sat mesmerised watching the younger orangutans playing before they were also fed. At the nursery you sit in a glass fronted auditorium which was air conditioned, so the youngsters do not see you and get too familier with humans. We had lunch at the onsite cafe was was just ok, very basic before returning to the nursery. Absolute fantastic time"

Then they take you to the outside feeding platform and you can see not only orangutans but also other monkeys. We were passing by in the afternoon and saw huge buses and way more people coming in, so it looks like morning session was the choice.Because it's almost impossible to see orangutans in the wild (especially if you have little time and cannot go deep into the jungle), this is your option how to see them conveniently. They unfortunately might not be on this planet soon. So don't complain that it's like a ZOO and go. You will support the centre's run and good cause."

Presumably to protect mums and babies. We learnt if it‚Äôs raining the orangutans stay hidden in the trees. However in the afternoon there were lots of orangutans in the trees and on the planked walk ways. They are very tame as they are used to human contact. We went back again the next day and again saw quite a few hanging around near the nursery rather than on the feeding platform.

I went twice, morning feeding showed one orang utan with her baby but there were so many macaques that she left. The nursery was cute, it's were they teach the orang utans their skills. It's possible to also see wild orang utans as they are welcomed. When I came back in the afternoon, I watched the video near the lockers (oh yeah, you have to out your bag in a locker, it's free). It was a nice movie that tells you what they do and why. I missed the second feeding because I saw 3 orang utans in a tree near the nursery and watched them as they came down and closer...and closer until they were on the boardwalk and we all stood super still and let them pass with only a meter in between us. Quite exciting to be so close. I understand the work that they're doing but as orang utans are very shy but got this close to people, I wonder about the effects this programm has on them. And if they would get this close to people in the wild as well and think people are not harmfull (even when it could be hunters or whatever).

If you do nothing else in Borneo, visit this amazing place.  Whilst there please look at the adoption. Ir is so cheap to visit that a little extra will go so far.

It is worthwhile to watch the information video about the sanctuary and the work they are doing.If you are expecting an amazing experience to see the orangutans in the wild I really wouldn‚Äôt advocate coming here it is essentially a rehabilitation centre that is extremely busy with bus loads of tourists. If you are near by definitely visit but if your trip is based around seeing the orangutans at Sepilok you might be a bit disappointed. If you just want to tick off seeing an orangutan you will get some nice pictures and see them up close.

The nursery is cool with good viewing points. The feeding platform was overrun with monkeys when we were there so we didn't get to see any larger orang-utans feeding.

Our first tip is to watch the overview video when you first arrive before going to the indoor feeding area and then the outdoor feeding platform. Everything is very well done and the orangutans seem very happy and healthy. Probably our only criticism (which is more about people than the Centre) is that visitors stand up at the glass in the indoor viewing area preventing everyone sitting in the designated viewing area from seeing. The outdoor viewing area is huge - we were lucky to be there in wet season when the crowds were small, but we were told it gets very busy, and ability to view the orangutans much more difficult, in high season.

While the orangutans were not impressed, the crowd sure was! They would sneak over to the food pile (by tip-toeing) that was not a secret to anyone and try to grab some bananas and run back to their side of the platform.This place does get pretty busy from what I saw but the areas are large enough to allow everyone a good view."

4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 2 November 2019,Family,Our local travel guide brought us here in the morning and it was fairly busy with tour groups but we were visiting out of peak season so were hopeful that we would see some orangutans. We waited for a group to pass us and quietly entered the boardwalk. Almost immediately Mariko and her baby descended from the trees and sauntered along the boardwalk in front of us occasionally glancing back. This was the first of several close encounters from our morning visit.  We also went to the nursery to watch the babies playing and eating (we  were behind glass to protect the babies from infection). Our guide explained that because of the mass flowering and fruiting in 2019 there was still an abundance of fruit so the feeding platform would be quiet. In many respects this is a good thing as it shows the animals are finding their own food to eat. There was a lone orangutan who was being irritated by a pesky macaque. The centre closes for a couple of hours around lunch time and as we were staying close by we decided to return in the afternoon on our own. It was much quieter from a human perspective but we still got a show from one of the orangutans that was swaying around on a young tree.  Again we saw other orangs along the boardwalk and were lucky to see a mother and baby on the feeding platform. As another guide said to us on our later in our trip nature's order decides what you see. My only criticisms are that it would be good for the centre to have a resident expert to give a talk about the work being done and the impact of habitat loss (it's very much self guided) and also perhaps a way for younger visitors to identify which orangutans they have spotted (like a bingo game or a smartphone app) just to maintain the interest of easily distracted minds. We all enjoyed our visit but feel sad that our demand for palm oil is a primary cause in the decline of one of our closest relatives.

My close encounter with an orangutan was here, I accidentally clicked the rainforest discovery centre tab. A mother orangutan decided to climb onto the boardwalk beside me and use the handrails to walk about 100 metres, you can‚Äôt stay 10m back when she keeps walking at you. The centre is right next door to the sun bear centre, and about 50 minutes drive from Sandakan. Go early as it get quite busy and you want to be at the platform to see the morning feeding session"

The feeding platforms / feeding times offer the opportunity for you to see adult orangutans, however because they can wonder around at their own leisure they may show up or they may not. Lots of people gather for to see this and sometimes other people are loud which is a little frustrating. You can go and watch the baby orangutans in the nursery where there is a shop where you can buy a drink. You can also sit in the air conditioned room and watch the younger orangutans play and eat. "

We spent hours here just watching the adult and infant Orangutans in their natural habitat. The adults are free to just come and go as they please, whilst the infants have a beautiful play and feeding area that also allows them to explore their native habitat in safety.Our best encounter actually came on our walk back to the hotel. We had an adult Orangutan stroll out in front of us and casually perch itself on a fence pole. He/she had no issues with us and we managed some awesome portrait photos...once in a lifetime encounter!!!Tip: get to the feeding platform at 940. Get a spot on the raised viewing area and don‚Äôt move.  This spot is the best area for viewing and the closest to where they will all congregate for the buffet.Reason for 4 stars not 5? It is unfortunate that we did not have the option of contributing to the root cause and very reason the Centre exists i.e. halting the deforestation of the Orangutans natural habitat.It was also disheartening to see a cafe packed full of sugar ingredients from the palm industry, especially after we just repeatedly heard and read about the loss of their habitat to industry,s such as this one. Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if the cafe only served palm sugar/oil free products? I think u have missed a great marketing opportunity to set a global example of how we (the consumers of this stuff) can begin living without one of the major ingredients that contributes to the loss of the orangutans habitat?"

We certanly weren't dissapointed! We went with a very small tour group and our guide was very knowledgable of the facilities. Visiting the nusery area first provided a great view of over a dozen orangutans and to see them eat, swing around and interact with the staff was fantastic. The outdoor feeding platform also provided a great spectacle and we were fotunate to have around half a dozen orangutans visit including a mum and her baby. We just stayed for an hour watchng these magnificent animals.The centre obviously does some very special work in caring and rehibilitating the orangutans and the video presentation provided is very informative.

Nursery and feeding platform are accessible by a boardwalk (5 minute walk). Feeding happens at 10.00am and 3.00pm. But be mindful the centre is closed between 12.00pm and 2.00pm. Nursery is worth spending some 15 minutes, but give yourself more time by the feeding platform. Usually feeding times are well-attended, so make sure to arrive a bit in advance to get the best place. Don‚Äôt cancel your plans if it rains! The ‚Äúrangers‚Äù in the park still drop food on the platform, and orangutans will come and get food once the rain stops. You just need a bit of patience.

You start watching an interesting film about the centre, its history and what they have been doing since they started in 1964 to rescue orphans and injured and sick orangutans. If you want to get an upfront space for the best photos, get to the feeding station by 9:30 for the 10 am feeding. We were lucky and saw about 10 orangutans, including a mother and baby. Watching them is mesmerizing. If you don't get there early, you will be surrounded by big tour groups and won't be able to get good photos. After you have your fill of the feeding, take a walk to the nursery to see the recovering animals. We heard loud roars of pygmy elephants as there is a sanctuary for orphan elephants there, but you won't be able to visit them. Then walk across the street to the Sun Bear Conservation Centre.

For a visitor, the more primates the better, while for the Centre, they‚Äôre happy with less. Less orang utans dropping by for a feed is a good sign, as it means they‚Äôve truly gone back to being wild.Two main attractions - the nursery and the feeding platform. The former is for resident orang utans - who are being rehabilitated, while the latter is for anyone who drops by. I saw three orang utans and countless macaque monkeys (opportunists) at the feeding platform.100% worth the visit for anyone interested in these wonderful relatives of ours, and of course we learn about their plight at the hands of palm oil developers and other such woes."

You must leave bags, food and even water locked outside. After one of the orangutans was trying to take a man‚Äôs phone, I do understand the precautions. Although it was quite amusing, found it a bit scary. Cafeteria at the entrance serves also cooked food, which we enjoyed. "

You may or may not see any orangutan even at feeding times but you will certainly see the young ones at the nursery behind glass.  We were picked up at the airport by Sukau Rainforest Lodge and the took us here on out way to the lodge. Very clever to make sure you get your orangutan fix before trying your luck in the Kinabatangan wilderness area. Of course there is never any guarantee with wild life but there is always hope üòâ We did not see any in the 4 days we were in Sukau üò© but were lucky enough to spot a mother & baby near Gomentang Caves.So should you visit Sepilok if you are going orangutan tracking in the wilderness?

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 28 September 2019,Friends,I visited here and was absolutely blown away by the care of the animals and the work they do. We turned up and saw the morning session at the feeding platform and were lucky enough to see a female orangutan visit it.  Obviously it is up to chance if they do come but you get to go and watch some adolescent Orangutans play and feed from an indoor viewing area. To see the animals and the way the staff interact with them is priceless. It is a place everyone should visit. 
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 26 September 2019,Couples,I had read plenty of reviews prior to going so knew what to expect . Yes it is more like a zoo than expected but the orangutan are free to roam and come and go when they wish. We were lucky to see a young ape walking on the boardwalk in front of us and a couple of others in the trees. No orangutan came to the feeding station but this is a good sign as it means that they are feeding themselves in the forest. If anything there was not enough information about the work that they do. Would have been nice for someone to do a talk in the nursery. 
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 25 September 2019,Couples,"We had booked two orangutan sanctuaries for our stay in Borneo - the Seminggoh sanctuary in Sarawak and the Sepilok sanctuary in Sabah. We preferred Seminggoh as it was a little more ‚Äúnatural‚Äù - no nursery, less developed feeding platform. But we were also very lucky to see 5 orangutans when we visited. It would have been quite possible to see none at all. At Sepilok, seeing an orangutan seems almost guaranteed because of the nursery area catering for young orangutans. They will be semi-wild and roaming pretty freely, but you will see them from behind glass in a hut. You can then boardwalk to a feeding area to see whether any adult orangutans visit. It was pretty quiet when we visited - save for lots of humans! You really do have to come with the attitude that you‚Äôll see what you see. The sunbear conversation centre is on the same site. "

The video gave a really good background into the centre so I recommend watching it! We then made our way to nursery where we saw lots of orangutans playing, then towards the outdoor feeding platform. It gets very busy so I suggest arriving to feeding times early so you can get a good spot to take photographs. Most people left after half an hour or so but we stuck around, as a result we saw more orangutans in the trees near the pathways and walking along the boardwalks! We then went to the sun bears centre for midday- there‚Äôs not a lot to see here, can easily be done in an hour as there are only two platforms with short walks between but well worth a visit. We went back to the orangutan centre for 2pm to see the second feeding and staying almost until close. I suggest if you can, spend the whole day there, take your time for a chance of better sightings and just enjoy being amongst the amazing trees!! "

The arrival of the magnificent alpha male altered the demeanour of the group until he settled onto a feeding platform.

There were many visitors and their guides at the centre during the morning so much so we decided to return on our own later that afternoon and we were so pleased we did.  It was so much quieter and fewer crowds, we were able to meander around the sanctuary on our own and amazingly a mother and baby orangutan came out of the trees right in front of us and allowed us to walk closely behind her for at least 30 minutes, she even stopped periodically allowing us to take the most amazing close up photos of her and her baby.

The orangutang wasn‚Äôt aggressive but rather curious and just wouldn‚Äôt let me go. He started biting my shirt close to my body and had it by his hands. So please be careful while you are there! Not sure how I could have avoided this but be warned that this is a possibility and the likelihood of people actually helping you if you‚Äôre in this situation is slim, as they all ran away once it started to get scary. There were no staff around on the walkway. I did not intentionally get close to the orangutang, in fact I was trying to keep my distance when he was spotted.

We ate lunch at their cafe, which was okay, and stored our bags in their free lockers - you're not allowed to take any bags in with you. There were various sized lockers and were some that would take large backpacks.There was the option of a video but we'd gone to the sun bears first so didn't have time. The walkways allow you to walk to the feeding platform and to the nursery. The feeding platform is busy but easy to get a spot to see from. One keeper brought out food and one adult Orangutan soon arrived. The keeper then brought a second one along who had to be encouraged to come back a few times. They fed for maybe 15 minutes then left. There are two ways from there to the nursery. My husband and daughter got to see the first Orangutan up close as he walked along the walkway in front of them (protected by staff). The nursery is viewed from a glass surrounded seating area with airconditioning and drinks available. It was delightful to watch the young orangutans coming out holding hands with their keepers and going off to play on the ropes, climbing frames etc. We were able to enjoy watching them for maybe an hour and then the place was closed.It was fabulous to see the orangutans so closely, but it was topped the next day when we saw wild orangutans in the trees at the Rainforest Discovery Centre.The staff were friendly and they clearly do a great job looking after the orangutans in their care."

We went to the feeding platform which gets very busy. There was only one mother and baby there but she put on a show for us.

We spotted two young adult orang-utans who were playing in the forest, we stopped and they came so close and were so inquisitive we could have touched them!! In the nursery area we saw many young adults playing and having fun. The feeding station was very crowded and we didn't see any orang-utans we felt there were too many people and it was too noisy. It is a wonderful facility doing such a tremendous job to protect these beautiful animals. It is well worth watching the video they run explaining how the centre works, very informative."
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 24 August 2019,Couples,The sanctuary does such fantastic work to help protect these beautiful animals. Make sure you head to the nursery first as you are guaranteed to see the younger ones come out to feed. It gets very busy in the viewing room and we found it best to sit on the floor by the glass as you get great views. The staff are all very helpful and can explain/point out the orangutans. Watching the older orangutans who have been released come in for feeding is incredible. 
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 23 August 2019,Family,We visited Sepilok as a family of 4. Having read various reviews on here we decided not to take an organised tour because we didn‚Äôt want to be restricted to one viewing opportunity. I contacted a couple of operators and none were prepared to do a full day stay. We stayed at the Four Points Sheraton in Sandakan the night before (great hotel) and headed up to the sanctuary for 9.30am. The hotel arranged a driver for 160RM who stayed with us all day. I‚Äôm really glad we did stay all day because no orangutans came down for the morning feed. We popped over to the sun bears at lunch time and came back at 2pm and saw lots of orangutans both at the feeding station and along the boardwalk. I agree with some of the other reviewers in that more needs to be done to stop people being too noisy and also getting too close. One child tried to touch an orangutan because it was on the fence. The child‚Äôs parents didn‚Äôt attempt to stop her and it was only when I tried to pull her away myself (for fear the orangutan may actually hurt the child)  that her parents looked up from their phones!On entry to the feeding platform or the main boardwalks someone needs to make sure people are fully briefed (again) to stay back if they see them. The work they are doing is great. Definitely worth doing both the morning and afternoon feeding sessions to give a good chance of seeing them.

Visited multiple times during our 3 night stay at the Sepilok Nature Resort situated next door to maximise the all day ticket. Disappointed not to see any Orangs at both our morning visits to the feeding platforms but it is fruiting season and there are plenty of other feeding options available to the Orangs.The afternoon feedings delivered much better results - 3 Orangs the first day and 6 the second. A particular highlight on both days was close up viewings right next to the boardwalk of Bidu-Bidu who my daughter has sponsored for the last 2 years.This is a must see attraction on a visit to Sabah. Highly recommend a visit in the afternoon when the tour groups have left as this has produced better sightings on both our trips to Sabah.

They are released into the wild but a feeding platform provides both support to the released animals and a viewing opportunity for visitors. We didn't see any using this feeding station, but did see several orangutans close up whilst walking on the jungle trail within the centre."

The animals were clearly those who were observing! No briefing on respecting the orangutans and keeping quiet! Children were walking around watching films on phones and shouting!!! Adults chatting loudly even though there were signs saying Silence... in all of this none of the staff tried to manage or intervene in the situation! It was terrible!!! A short talk explaining that it‚Äôs fruiting season and that they may not be around would manage expectations and also develop a better sense of anticipation and respect. Even after complaining about the poor management there was no offer of a free ticket for the following morning because they totally abdicated their responsibility. So... if you want a better experience go to Kuching!! So much better, well organized, and utmost respect for the animals demonstrated! I agree totally with similar reviews on here. Do RDC night walk...amazing and sun bears but give this place a miss! "
2.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 14 August 2019,Family,"Sadly, the orangutan rehabilitation centre mainly consists of herds and herds of tourists being lead around the fairly short jungle boardwalk by their tour guides with the aim of getting to the feeding platform at the all important feeding time like their lives depended on it..once done the same herds quickly descend onto their tour buses or the sun bear centre (which is a bit better than the orangutan rehabilitation centre).The place does good work helping the orangutans but if you are expecting a personaly uplifting experience in the wilds of borneo, you'd be disappointed.. much better to go to the RDC nearby."

The ticket is a full day pass so you can go to both the morning and afternoon feeds. The afternoon feed was definitely quieter, but both times it was full of people shouting, laughing, and even children watching loud videos on iPads! Obviously it's going to be more difficult to see the orangutans if there's too much noise, and I feel that there should be more insistence on being quiet. Saying that, it was still a great experience seeing the orangutans and the nursery in the afternoon was lovely and quiet, so sat there for ages watching the younger ones playing."

During our first,more quick visit the orangutans didnt come to the feedingplatforms, as it is fruity season so they find enough to eat themselves. They can't guarantee orangutans showing up, however the nursery offers also an opportunity to see them play and we saw one in a nest near the pathwalk.

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 6 August 2019,,This was the highlight of our trip to Malaysia.  Lots of people review so I will add somethings we didn't know until we got there...It fully closes between 12 and 2 so you have to leave in the middle of the day.  We went to the jungle lodge down the road and had lunch and a swim - fab pool but a bit pricey for the dip!We saw the morning feeding with the adults then had another wander round before we had to leave.  We timed it to be back at 2 and as we already had tickets we could go straight in.  On our walk to the nursery we were lucky enough to have only a few people around us and we had an adult female orangutan wander along the boardwalk and we could watch it close up almost by ourselves.  Then after watching the nursery feeding we stayed on at the nursery a bit longer when most went to the afternoon adult feeding.  This meant we were able to walk back with no others around and we were again treated to an adult (male this time) orangutan wandering around by himself.   I would encourage you to escape the crowds and wander the boardwalks away from feedings if you have the time.  We also stayed to watch the video to see all the work the team are doing.  This is so underpriced for what it does.Transport back to Sandakan is either a bus or a taxi unless you have data for Grab as there is no wifi.  And we found no Grab drivers at the time we wanted to go back so we paid up.

Don‚Äôt miss the orangutan nursery and the audio visual display to give some background to the vital work of the Centre. Be prepared (we weren‚Äôt) to put all bags in storage during the walk and also that there isn‚Äôt any access to this between 12 and 2pm  though the cafe and AV presentation is still open. You have to pay extra to take a camera in with you, though this didn‚Äôt seem to apply to mobile phones. "

In an air conditioned room you can watch while young orangutans play outside. There is a vending machine for drinks and toilets in this building too. No food or drink allowed elsewhere. We headed to the feeding platform at 9:30 as the first feed is at 10. The horde of tourists is overwhelming and since it‚Äôs fruiting season it was no surprise that no orangutans showed up. We watched a squirrel eat the fruit and then decided to walk around again before heading back to the nursery. A bit dejected at that point. At the nursery we sat in the a/c until the baby orangutans were leaving around 11. As we left too, we could see them in the wild headed up the trees. Watched them for half an hour, including one cutie who looked like he was posing for all of us, before heading back to the exit for closing time. As we walked away we saw another orangutan in the trees. Had lunch at the cafe which was cheap and cheerful and then headed to the sun bears. Patience paid off in the end. "
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 4 August 2019,Friends,Once again this amazing species is under attack and your visit to a center like this helps support it.Illegal pet trade and palm oil are the threats to orangutans.Palm oil is in products hiding behind other names  so be careful and insist on ethically sourced palm oil products (good luck on that one). So this center gets these orangutans and babies and tries to get them back to the wild. You will see amazing behaviors and be memorized by as long as you stay. They orangutans have feeding platforms but sometimes there are no orangutans because they don't need this hand out. It is heart breaking to watch but again glad that there are centers like this around.

We were able to watch a documentary on the how and why etc before heading in to the park.   Within a few minutes walk we came across our first encounter with Kalabatu wandering along the rails of the walkway.   We were able to spend as long as we wanted and needed in the nursery.   We watched about 15 or so Orangutan eating, playing and all around being mischievous.   There was a mother and a baby learning the ropes and we were fascinated watching them.   Just on the outside of the Nursery there were another couple in the trees, again with a baby.   To be that close to them and watch them learning from others made our time at Sepilok.   The staff were helpful in pointing the Orangutan high in the trees out to us and we were able to ask many questions and learn from them.   We weren't as interested in the monkey further along the path but happy that we were able to see the feeding take place.   I could have stayed all day learning and watching the Orangutan."
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 1 August 2019,Family,"The orangutan rehabilitation centre is a 'must see' in Sepilok. In a fantastic jungle location it cares for many rescued orangutans. Some are babies that  have been orphaned; others are rescued after habitat destruction or from the pet trade. They are cared for and, where possible, trained for return to the wild. It is important to remember what it is: sights of the orangutans are not guaranteed though I think you would be very unlucky to see none at all! It's well organised with boardwalks to lead you through the sanctuary.Where we felt it was lacking was in information and explanation for visitors. There is no display explaining what has happened and is happening  and why or what might now be done.  People need the context. The shop also represented a huge missed fundraising opportunity! It is very small, the offerings unexciting and cheap-looking. More quality products, maybe showcasing local crafts,  and books would be good.SO! It's very worth visiting but I do hope that some things will change in respect of improving the visitor experience."

The highlight was being able to watch the young orangutans playing in the outdoor nursery. We were delighted to be able to go back again in the afternoon. Much quieter with fewer visitors. We were fortunate to see a young orangutan come to one of the feeding platforms and then saw 3 walking around the boardwalk which was a privilege. The work they do at Sepilok is to be commended - it is very much for the benefit of the animals and not the humans, which should be remembered when reading any reviews which are perhaps not that positive. It is also likely that if you visit during the fruiting season you will probably see fewer orangutans out and about at the centre as they will be getting their own food from the forest, which is the whole point of the rehabilitation centre üôÇ"

If you visit in the morning you can return in the afternoon for free on the same ticket.  Do bear in mind mornings are very busy compared to the afternoons which are much quieter.You can go to the nursery area to watch the younger orangutans and you can go to the feeding area but also find some time to just wander the boardwalk between the two - this is where we had our best sightings and found ourselves completely on our own watching the orangutans in the trees at very close proximity.Bear in mind they only take cash (no card payments).

Unfortunately no orangutans turned up for that and as there was still food left from the morning on the platform I guess there is plenty for them to eat in the forest at the moment.  However on our walk back there was an orangutan making his evening nest right on the side of the path which was lovely to watch.   We went on down to the nursery and sat for sometime watching the little ones play.Next morning we went back again and still no show at  the feeding station.

We stayed there for 30 minutes.  then we were told to go to another area as they put some food on a platform for the adult Orangutans to come and eat and so for us to see.  We waited in high heat for about 2 hours whilst being bitten, no drinks.  Talking with the employees overseeing this wait we were told that no orangutans would come as there is plenty of food elsewhere and so they only put a little out to pretend for us that there is something worth waiting for.  The cost is not little and so suffice to say that we were disappointed. "
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 24 July 2019,Friends,"The Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre was one of our favorite activities in the Sandakan area, as you cannot come to Borneo and miss out on orangutans. We were lucky enough to view orangutans in the wild near the Kinabatangan River, but it was also fun seeing them at the centre. The visit to the centre was informative and fun. It was great to see the orangutans up close and personal, and to learn about how the palm oil industry and deforestation is negatively impacting these beautiful creatures.  The centre is doing great work to try to save the orangutans from extinction and we were happy to support their efforts with a visit. We would recommend arriving to the centre for the 10am feeding, and perhaps visiting the nursery. At some point, visit the sun bears across the street (you only need an hour or two to visit), have lunch (we recommend the restaurant at Sepilok Nature Resort), and then returning to the centre for the 2pm movie and then the 3pm feeding. The centre closes midday (between 12pm and 2pm, I believe) to give the orangutans a rest from visitors. It was great for us to have the flexibility to attend both of the feedings, as the day we visited, no orangutans came to the 10am feeding. The cost is 30 MYR per adult and they do not accept credit cards. This is a must do in the Sandakan/Sepilok area, so definitely don‚Äôt miss out! "

My wife and I saw baby Orang-utans in the nursery but no 'tans appeared for the 10am feeding in the forest. It was great to see the 'tans but also saw how well they are being looked after. Felt they were better treated at Sepilok than Semenggoh. More because I felt they were looked after with dignity and with their welfare in my mind, rather than simply a tourist attraction. The area was boardwalked for tourists so no issues getting round. The rehab centre understands that they need the tourists to help fund the research and welfare of the 'tans. To this end, they've made the centre as comfortable as possible for the tourists whilst minimising impact to the wildlife.¬† The trip was made all the more enjoyable having Albert from SI Tours as our guide.

We also spotted them ambling and climbing along on and near the walkways (keep your distance). Make sure you head to the nursery, which has an air conditioned observation area, and it's own feeding session 30 minutes after the first platform. Here we observed the orangutans (and later macaques) at their best, playing around, for ages. It felt really natural, perhaps because they didn't feel watched because we were behind glass.

It was amazing to see them being taken care of so well as they're rehabilitated in the hope of making them independent and able to survive on their own in the wild. The rainforest they live in is large so they can hide as far away from tourists as they want and only come close if they choose to. The viewing platforms for the feeding time in the morning both in the nursery and outside for the older orang-utans was very crowded with tourists, however we enjoyed ourselves so much we went back for the afternoon feeding which was less crowded.

The ""nursery"" was great to observe and the care and attention to keeping the centre as close to natural as possible was great to see. I would suggest you go twice - as owing to the fact these are still wild animals there are no guarantees of seeing anything at all. We were really lucky."

Highly recommend getting there when it opens at 9am so you can see the first feeding time. This is where you will see most of the smaller orangutans in their feeding nursery. They are very cool and super cute and clever. Just to manage your expectations the nursery you view them in is behind glass but it is truly lovely to watch them feed and play. (It is also air conditioned for your comfort) And you can stay in there as long as you want. For the rest of your time there is a raised walkway around the rest of the sanctuary which is beautiful to walk through but depending on your luck you may or not see orangutans in the trees or near you on the walkway. It‚Äôs a nice walk through the jungle but really won‚Äôt take you very long as it‚Äôs not very big really. Depending on how long you are willing to wait to see them, you can probably be done by about 11am if you get there early. Some people came an hour or so after us and saw nothing in the nursery because they missed the feeding time when they are most active. Come early! Also if you fly from anywhere in the north of Borneo you can see both sun bears and orangutans in about 2/3 hours tops. So you could make an early 7am flight (we flew fromKota Kinabalu) and happily get back to the airport for the 2pm air Asia flight and have seen both sanctuaries. There is not a lot else around that area so come just for this then you can head off to catch the rest of your day. There is a small rustic cafeteria that sells really nice cheap Malaysian food and snacks. Lovely seafood noodles! You can put your bags in Keyed lockers so everything is safe. When it closes at 11am head over to the sun bears - they are lovely and we saw quite a few, maybe 5 or 6. Lovely to see but DEFINITELY come early and you can be done by lunchtime. :-) "

We had some laughs too at one cheeky monkey that wanted his way with a female several times. The staff do an amazing role some working as volunteers to nurse and rescue these beautiful mammals. We have some fab pictures to treasure a life time. Only downfall was the amount of screaming kids, was awful and parents need to tame them instead of allowing them to run around like it‚Äôs a park. These Orang-utans  need quiet and should not be expected to be fearful in a place that is meant to be a ‚ÄúSanctuary‚Äù We have adopted an Orang-utan, for ¬£40 for the year is a drop in the ocean and we hope that small amount will go far in allowing the staff to continue to give hope to a beautiful creature that is being damaged through money and selfishness.

It‚Äôs great to see the urang utans in the semi-wild and it‚Äôs funny to see them playing around. However, the animals are quite tame so you might get the feeling that you‚Äôre in an upgraded zoo.

Your entry fee helps the centre in its rehabilitation programme to train the young orangutans to survive in the wild.The centre was started in 1964 by a UK charity organization, and it does great work.Many oranugtans come here as orphaned babies or retrieved from those who have them as ""pets"". They start in the nursery where they learn climbing skills etc. Eventually they are released into the local area, which is open so they can leave if they wish. But they do come to the daily feedings - not always as the staff purposely only feeds them mostly bananas so they have to forage for themselves for other types of food.When they have shown adequate survival skills they are taken to central Sabah and released into the wild.As well as the park workers there are a number of volunteers, particularly from the UK, who work here.But make sure you go at feeding time, otherwise you may see the baby orangutans in the nursery only."

Human contact is kept to a minimum - only the staff with them - walking along the boardwalks we managed to see one orangutan in the top of a tree. At the feeding centre we saw more behind the glass. Here they played and ate together, but some of them swung off into the jungle. We walked to another open feeding platform, but only saw a squirrel take advantage of the free food on offer. Cannot complain as the purpose of the centre is to make the orangutans wild and not dependent on humans so not seeing them, although disappointing, is a success story for the centre."

As we walked along the boardwalk from the entrance we were met by our first orangutan, who swung down from the trees and casually walked past us on the railing. What a start! During the day we visited twice and while the number of orangutans we saw was about the same each time (12) the afternoon was quieter. In the morning there were a number of tour groups ( though thankfully no coach loads) so there were more people on the viewing platform which could become crowded with everyone‚Äôs camera focused on the same area. I applaud the work being done by this centre, as they seem genuine in what they are doing and are actually making a difference. The video presentation is worth seeing as it explains all the stages in the rehabilitation. It can be quite warm on the viewing platform but the viewing of the outdoor nursery is from the air conditioned comfort of a glass fronted viewing room. There is also a cafeteria where you can buy water ( amongst other things) to rehydrate. Note that you are not allowed to take anything inside with you ie no bags, water bottles etc to prevent any incidents with the orangutans making off with your stuff. You can have cameras and phones in your hand to take pics, but will need to pay a fee of 10RM (cameras only)"
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 6 May 2019,Couples,"The orangutans are the main reason that we came to Borneo and Me and my partner had such an amazing experience spotting these orangutans in their natural environment. It‚Äôs quite cheap for the entrance fee and you aren‚Äôt allowed to bring in any bags/bottles or anything other than cameras which have to be under a certain lense length (or something like that, I‚Äôm no photographer). They provide you with a locker for your stuff free of charge. Firstly I would like to say that this centre is not a zoo, whilst these orangutans have been rehabilitated they are free to come and go as they please along with other monkey species and other wildlife which live amongst the rainforest also. The Orangutans are free to do whatever they like therefore there is no guarantee that you will spot them. I thought this was obvious but by some of the other reviews it seems not. If you would like to have guaranteed sightings then please, go to a zoo. The whole excitement about visiting Sepilok is to see wildlife living in its natural habitat, not locked in a cage. There is however a nursery section of the park where you will more than likely see the young orangutans, swinging, playing and eating.You start by walking along the wooden walkway looking out high and low among the trees searching for wildlife, eventually it leads you to the nursery where you can see the young Orangutans. Feedings are at 10:00am and 3:00pm. You can head along to the feeding platform where the staff will put out fruit and vegetables for the Orangutans - but remember this is the jungle and the Orangutans aren‚Äôt the only inhabitants which enjoy munching fruit and veg. Many Macaques will most certainly come down to enjoy the food, we had a full family come and eat a large majority of the food left out. We waited around a while and a bit further along the platform to everyone‚Äôs excited came an Orangutan swinging through the trees making its way to the feeding platform. Only one Orangutan came to the feeding platform at this occasion. But nevertheless we got a good up close sighting of this beautiful animal.It seems to our surprise that most people come to the centre, watch the feeding and then leave. Then continue to write their reviews on how they never got to see any orangutans or that their experience wasn‚Äôt good. Me and my partner made sure to circle around the centre many times trying to spot wildlife, we saw orangutans up high in the trees and just outside the nursery. At just before closing time we were the only two people left in the park, we decided to do one last lap of the feeding area and on our way out we heard some loud rustling in the trees, we thought there was no way it could just be a bird or small monkey and thought it had to be Orangutans and more than one at that! We waited around a few minutes following the rustling in the trees and to our excitement and full family of around 3 adult orangutans all carrying infants and some junior Orangutans closely following behind swinging in the trees, they came right down to the wooden walkway right up close to us and walked right past us, a truely unforgettable experience. Of course I know that we were extremely lucky on this occasion but we were persistent and patient like you have to be when spotting wildlife and it paid off in the end, if you are patient too then it could pay off for you as well."

One afternoon session was perfect - we saw around 10 orang-utans with many mother and babies in a peaceful environment with a respectful crowd who observed in silence. The other three times was the opposite with big loud crowds, and only one or two orang-utans appeared. We were surprised that no one was enforcing silence at the feeding station. However, we still had a magical experience once the crowds lefts as the orang-utans slowly started to appear at various spots. We watched 4 just playing with each other from about 4 metres away, and then followed at a distance as they went into the trees to feed themselves. Really worth the wait and multiple visits!

In the afternoon we went to the outdoor platform - one adult female Orangutan could be seen, but she was essentially brought along by a ranger, and didn't look too interested in being there!

Although one of the orangutan would like to approach us, but the ranger of the centre chase them away because they were not allowed to approach with human due to sensitive of the health. Ranger told us that one of the orangutan was pregnant, so it was best to avoid any possible close interaction between orangutan and human. Orangutan had the same health issues as human.

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 6 April 2019,Family,"We visited the centre three times during our visit in Sandakan.  All three times were completely different and each hugely rewarding. Points to note - morning feeding time is 10am.  You can visit the outdoor nursery before or after.  We did both and both times we saw the smaller/juvenile orangs playing and practising their skills.  The first feeding time no orangs came.  Instead there were two different types of Macaques.  Once they are there in numbers the orangs won‚Äôt come.  But at least you‚Äôve seen something.  Second time Wulan, 5 months pregnant mother to be came, third time nothing  at all!  No monkeys or orangs.  So it really is down to luck.  A good thing if they don‚Äôt come as they are obviously successfully living in the wild without the need for a ‚Äòtop up‚Äô.  The outdoor nursery is awesome we saw loads of orangs there and they are such characters.  They are free to come and go, and we loved watching them leave after they‚Äôd eaten, especially the little guy who ‚Äòcartwheels‚Äô along the rope.  Such fun.  Along the walkways to the platform we were lucky to have very close encounters too (a lot of people walk head down and miss sightings - go slowly, look up!!).  We met Matimas and her 6 week old baby at almost touching distance, a true delight, and a young male walking along the platform almost ‚Äòleading‚Äô us to the nursery!  As well we had an orange to ourselves with a few others for at least 5 minutes, sitting and moving through the trees completely comfortable with our happy whispers of glee at being near him.  Our visits were further enriched thanks to meeting a wonderful volunteer, Rachel, who shared priceless information about the orangs, bringing their characters to life even more.  Thank you Tachel!  We also heard some wild elephants whilst walking to the platform too.  Our advice would be to give yourself enough time here to really sit and enjoy, don‚Äôt rush through on a tour or walk along checking your phone!  This is surely one of the main reasons to be in Sandakan, it‚Äôs a once in a lifetime chance to experience these beautiful creatures so close."

Maybe I've just been spoiled by my trips to Sri Lanka and Costa Rica but I thought this place had been commercialised a little too much.I arrived for the feeding time (which I thought was zoo like anyway) and realised this also the time when hoards of tourists flock onto the walk ways.When I first arrived it was very quiet and I got to see a few orangutans coming down onto the walkway areas which was great but as soon as many people arrived I didn't see another one. The last one I saw resulted in many people with large cameras hearding around not actually looking and appreciating but just getting that perfect Instagram post.There is a nursery area but there's something with viewing monkeys/orangutans behind glass that doesn't appeal to me. I thought this would be a larger centre with many areas to walk in where you might be able to see one in a tree from a far etc but it didn't live up to the reviews.I probably should say that as a charity it does some really good work to rehabilitate not just orangutans but other jungle animals as well.

No show from the orangutans and it was merely a feeding for the local macaques. The rehabilitation center was like being in a zoo. There were no up and close moments with those majestic creatures.  "

On arrival you watch a very informative video about Orangutans, Sun Bears and the centre itself. Then you go to a feeding viewing platform and await your first sighting, then a female Orangutan with her baby clinging to her appeared and swung onto the platform. What an absolutely fantastic sight watching an Orangutan feeding in their natural environment, even though only one appeared it was still amazing.We were then taken into a building with a huge window wall viewing a load of wood climbing frames and ropes, this is the playground for the preteens orangutans. Then all of a sudden about six young orangutans appeared, cute does not justify how they look. They seem to be showing off to the crowd, they were absolutely hilarious, swinging, jumping, rolling and falling about. I did not want to leave this area at all.Final call was to see the Sun bears, these were very cute too and well worth seeing but I have to admit I've fallen in love with the Orangutans.We booked the tour with Borneo Eco Tours and our guide Jonathan was very knowledgeable and answered all our questions even the daft ones. Can not recommend this place enough."

The reason I did not rate five stars is because it gets extremely crowded and people can be rude, which can make the experience about dealing with frustrating people, rather than focusing on the wildlife.You walk down multiple long raised plank walkways to get to an air-conditioned room where you face out watching the keeper drop bananas for the orangs.  They are so happy and fun to watch.  Amazing creatures.  It was fun to see smaller monkeys come try to steal bananas when the keepers or orangs weren't watching.There are multiple platforms, so you can try to wander around, but towards 11am, it was so crowded, that we just wanted to leave, because we couldn't really see because people were shoulder-to-shoulder and it's miserably hot outside.Definitely worth a visit and it's also great to know that your ticket price helps with conservation efforts."

Anger that these beautiful animals are endangered but relief that so many people are involved in helping them survive now. We were lucky enough to get quite close to one who walked across the walkway towards the feeding platform. Loved watching the little ones play and learn how to swing through the trees. Keep up the good work and perhaps one day you will not be needed anymore as they will be safe and able to live in the wild."

I miss those beautiful creatures so very much The work that Sepilok do for Orangutans is beyond incredible and the staff there are quite simply heroes. It's amazing to see such magnificent creatures in a protected area where they can come and go freely knowing that there is food, water and medical care readily available for them when they need it.As a visitor to Sepilok you can view the Orangutans from 2 separate feeding platforms (one outside - this is VERY hot and you definitely need bug spray) and (one inside with glass windows and air con) please remember this is NOT  a zoo and the Orangs can come and go freely as they wish!It is quite a walk to the feeding platforms and this is along wooden platforms through the jungle. There is a variety of other wildlife around! It is advisable to take and wear surgical masks if you end up close to an Orangutan as they carry 97% of our DNA and they can contract human germs very easily which can be deadly to them.There are 2 separate feeding times, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.There are some fabulous photo opportunities here and it really is just such a special place. You are not allowed to take anything but a camera into the reserve and you will be asked to leave everything else in a locker, this includes camera cases!! The entrance fee is minimal and there are some souvenirs to buy on exit, Orangutan Appeal UK also offer the chance to adopt an Orangutan which I really recommend. There is a cafe onsite selling a variety of nice food, drinks and ice creams, there is plenty of parking if you are driving. As I say I can not put into words how special this place is to me and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. It can get hot and it can get busy and the orangs are free to come and go as they please so some days there will be very little activity and others there will be mounds but it is so so worth it!! If possible I would advise visiting a few times as no 2 experiences are the same here!!"

The viewing rooms to see and photograph the baby orangutans was very good with people at the front asked to sit on the floor so that everyone could see. After the morning viewing we then went to the jungle feeding platform and although there was the tours from a cruise ship there it was still possible to have a good view and get good photos. We did it all again for the afternoon session.Wonderful experience!
2.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 25 March 2019,Couples,I had been looking forward to the visit and it started off well with the showing of a film. We then went to the feeding platform and were lucky enough to see orangutans. There were quite a lot of people at the platform and it was surprisingly noisy. Some people I spoke to had visited the previous day and had not seen an orangutan. After that we went to the nursery platform. Again we saw orangutans but we were sat in a room looking through glass. I hadn‚Äôt expected this as it felt like being at the zoo. It was very noisy. The centre does amazing work but my experience was disappointing.
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 24 March 2019,Couples,We stayed nearby un the Sepilok Nature resort so we arrived early about 8.30. Small queue to get a ticket. Put stuff in a locker and walked to the baby area. Weirdly we were all sat behind glass and looked out on the baby apes feeding. Not quite what I was expecting. Next we all walked (approx 100 people ) over to the feeding platform. Waited till 10 am when a man appeared carrying a basket of food. He placed the food on the platform and a mother and three of her babies appeared (who had been high in a nest next to the stand. )TBH it wasn‚Äôt the wild orgutan experience I hoped for. It was all very managed. Maybe we went at the wrong time. The cafe on site is good. Cheap and food is good. Stick to Malay food though. Don‚Äôt go for burger and chips or you will be disappointed. No shortage of Grabs I the area so you can get back into Sandakan if you are going that way. We stayed in a resort nearby and used Grab a lot. Taxis were not a good experience and charged at least 3 times as much.

We got to see the big dominant male from the area who is supposedly full wild (i.e. was never rehabilitated) as well as 5 other orangutans and that was just at the one feeding platform. We went only to the afternoon feeding (missed the morning) but we still loved it. They have free lockers to use so you don't have any bags with the Orang Utans as they will try to steal things (or so they warn). which worked great for us because we had our big backpacks and day bags) We fit all four of our big bags and three day packs in one of their lockers but they have many smaller ones too. There is a cafeteria on site but we didn't try it. Didn't have any trouble getting a Grab into Sandakan so I wouldn't bother doing a tour. We were skunked in Semenggoh (Kuching) because it was fruiting season, but had no problem seeing Orang Utans here! There are a lot of people on the viewing platform but March is a good time to go because it is a bit quieter I think; we still had lots of room to move around and got excellent views. I recommend you bring binnoculars if you want close ups. Cameras are an extra 10RM but worth it (more if you have a professional lens over 500mm)."

We saw no orangutans at the 10 AM feeding and were disappointed, but managed to squeeze in the 3 PM one as well before returning to the airport and the second showing was a fantastic experience!It's a shame that the orangutans that are nursed could only be seen through a window."

We saw the youngsters through a secure window, but plenty of photo opportunities to be had (no flash please as it alarms the Orangutans).  You then walk through an enclosure to see the teenagers roaming freely.  Don't take food, or anything you don't want to lose ie hats, cameras etc you must be able to hold on to them as the orangutans can appear very suddenly, and as they are 4x stronger, they will relieve you of your items.  They were adorable to watch and the sanctuary is doing a wonderful job.  Make sure you wear insect repellent."

2.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 11 March 2019,Couples,Sepilok reviews are saying is the best center to visit as Borneo have many of them. We visit few and Sepilok is charging more for entrance fees and  was fine with us cause they do have a nursery and reputation beeing the biggest center ... But we expected more of what we got. I feel all the interest was about money and maybe I m wrong but usually my feeling are good. They charge you another 10 Ringet extra for your camera not phone but camera. Why? Does it cost the center something more when you bring your camera ? No ... Than to volunteer there for 8 weeks is almost 7000$ US when I ask why to give your time it s so expensive ... The answer was cause they can ...people are ready to paid the price and they have a lot people wanted to volunteer ..The problem is when you ask for volunteers is cause you need help I would think.. But seems they do not and used this as money maker. And really I could give you at least 3 recommendations of need for staff you could used. like more surveillance to keep the place quiet more information and briefing on the Apes .. as the reason we all come see them is to supported the cause of saving orangoutanngs otherwise we could see them in a zoo right? They could easily set a list of volunteers who waant to come and make them work not necessarily with the apes but also for the cause like reaching out outside help from their respective countries maybe or created a network of contact etc .. .and go by turn with a reasonable cost to cover accomodation and foods or no cost if the volunteer prefer stayed outside the center and cover is own expenses. I means if they have so much people's coming for those program let s go with a minimum then of 2 for one month bring 14000$ US plus all entrance fees and camera fees and sale of souvenirs etc ... I m sure they have big expenses for the nursery etc..but  I could not see where all money goes and as it s a cause that touch millions of people's they should be transparent cause is not a private business ! we were in low season and they had still around 100 people's there that day  .... it s a non sense and I really feel it s about money not the ourangoutans. oh and on a top you should have a private guide ..really? The other center had rangers explaining the crowd to not make noise and give us facts about orangs outangs .. over there all we saw is staff talk between them not controling people at all to keep the place quiet was like beeing in a zoo..  For feeding time they throw a bunch of bananas that's it and one came... Witch is ok as if they don t come it means they get what they need by themself and a sign said they only give them bananas so they get bored of this food and force them to go in the forest.  But don t tell me a little bunch of bananas is what cost a lot for explaining your big expenses. They do have sign everywhere and advice you to be quiet and not disturbed anything or anyone. But that was another upsetting moment... as this is not respect at all ! So noisy people talk laugh and Ranger and staff do nothing ..guide talk loud with their groups and disturbed others ..with the money they collect they and so much volunteer wanted to come maybe they can add more staff to keep the place peacefull and enjoyable. And if someone still talk well expulse them to respect other that also paid to get there. We were going to adopt one to support the cause as online seem to be a big need but when we saw all that we decided not doing it. Finally another suggestions is show where money goes and promoted the real thing by sensibilsed visitors to the real problems the palm plantation !! Ask them to sign petitions give them tools to help not just coming give money to see the monkey like in a zoo and so maybe one day orangoutanngs will  have a jungle to leave in as right now seeing from the air all Borneo chop chop they do on rain forest for supplied demand on oil palm is no point to help rheabilitation center cause soon you  won t have any jungle left to release those animals!!! Maybe you have to really make people who visit the center understand and promote the real cause not just come to visit a zoo as it s not what you supposed to be.

The juveniles are hilarious as they play in the nursery area, but your photos won't be as good as you are taking them through glass. The feeding platforms for the adults is quite a distance from the viewing area, and most of the time the orang utans had their backs to us so we didn't get to see much at the two feeding times we were there. The staff will occasionally block your access to the walk ways if there is an aggressive orang utan crossing the jungle near the walk way. Sadly, this place doesn't have any organ utan stuffed toys for sale, but you can get them at the nearby nature reserve. Don't expect to be able to pat an orang utan, that's not what this place is about, and they also don't guarantee that you'll see an orang utan!"

We ended up going to both morning and afternoon openings (your ticket permits you to visit twice in that one day, so keep hold of it) and we walked around the walkways twice each time! Our afternoon visit turned out to be even more eventful than the morning... we saw a mother and her baby come to the feeding platforms which was really special.

Many visitors arrive for the morning session but leave before lunch and we saw so much that the majority of visitors missed. There are spaces to sit and watch and the orangoutangs are never too far that you have nothing to see or wait for. We saw many families swinging around and playing and eating, the chief male, mothers with tiny babies, and lots of interacting apes having fun. The facility has free lockers to store your bags, good clean restroom facilities, an inexpensive cafe open all day and a large car park. The facility closes briefly at lunchtime but it is just a couple of minutes walk from the bear sanctuary across the road that is also well worth a visit.

There are also feeding platforms outside of the nurseries where you may get a bit more of a wild experience however the best way to see the orangs is if you happened to catch one coming down when you are on the paths leading from the nursury to the feeding platform, in this case it seems like a proper wild encounter. We were very lucky to experience this when one of the apes came down right in front of us. I was able to get some video with just the orangutan and the natural jungle, nothing artificial such as ropes or other people in the shot at all, it looks great.¬†Your RM30 (¬£6) entrance fee lets you come and go all day, so you can come for morning feed and then return for the afternoon feed later in the day once you've been back to your lodge for a rest or out discovering other places."

The walk through the rainforest to the feeding platform or nursery begin to build your anticipation. On 2 out of 3 visits we saw Orangutans in the forest just doing their natural thing. The feeding platform does attract different numbers at different times, some people we spoke to said no orangutans appeared on one occasion. We were lucky as there was plenty of activity on all 3 occasions we were there. The range of age and development wa obvious from younger ones to at least one full grown male who ""bossed"" the area. Mothers also appeared with babies as young as 8 weeks or a couple of years old. While watching a male sitting in a treee near the platform we were all startled when the tree bent and he landed on the railing of the walkway we were standing on. He knew what he was doing as he calmly walked past the surprised and apprehensive people and then stood and posed for a few seconds before climbing off back into the tress - a close encounter indeed. The nursery of course was a delight to see the antics of the younger ones. Although you are behind glass you can still witness their play and development. While some of the young ones were being transferred to the play area one female ""escaped"" and climbed onto the roof of the building and sat there watching us watching her. After about 10 minutes she climbed down and headed towards the open area with a carer in hot pursuit. A really entertaining and humbling experience.Well worth the entrance fee as you can visit in the morning and the same fee allows entrance in the afternoon."

They use a buddy system to replace a mother‚Äôs teaching with younger apes being paired up with an older ‚Äûmentor ape‚Äú to help them to develop the skills they need: the 2 key skills being climbing and foraging for food. The orangutan babies are often caught during logging or forest clearance or captured by poachers who slaughter the adult apes. Palm oil plantations are everywhere and are the main source of income and survival for many families, so it‚Äòs a difficult juxtaposition with no simple solution. Need at least 2 hours to visit the nursery, walk through the forest, watch feeding time and see the educational video about the rehabilitation work they do.

Also, a Grab from Sandakan waterfront to Sepilok will cost you about 23 MYR.Our tour didn't include the sun bears or rainforest centre. We had done the rainforest independently two days before. We could have done the sun bears immediately after the orangutans. The guide was taking four members of our party there for 30 minutes while we had some downtime which meant we could either spend more time in the orangutang sanctuary or else just pay our own entrance to the sun bear centre and walk through it ourselves.

We got there in time for feeding 10am and we‚Äôre lucky enough to see a mother with her baby. We then went to the baby orangutan enclosure, and what a treat this was. 10/12 baby‚Äôs, all playing in a lovely space designed just for them. You could spend all day here watching these mischievous creatures. IncredibleThey close at 12 for a couple of hours, you can get lunch and then walk over to see the bears. We didn‚Äôt spend a lot of time here due to the other place opening again at 2pm. Going back we went back to the baby‚Äôs. Upon leaving we were greeted by 3 huge orangs in the woodland. Watching them play was fantastic but to top it all one smallish female decided to join us on the walkway, two feet away from us. This made the day complete for us. A must do if your anywhere near the placeWe also adopted a baby called Archie. ¬£40 a year. Couldn‚Äôt believe they wouldn‚Äôt let us take him home üòÄ"

It costs 30 Rm for an entry ticket and an extra 10 RM for your camera.  You have to store your bags before going in.  Just take your hat, sunglasses, camera and cell phone in your pockets.  Walk to the outdoor nursery where you can watch young orangutans through a large glass window in an air conditioned viewing area.  Depending on the time of day, you may see a couple or many.  We went twice and saw a lot of young ones.  At feeding time, go to the feeding platform.  On our first day we went to the 10 am morning feeding and saw several monkeys. People started to leave, then a large orangutan came.  It is crowded and you need to jockey to a good position to take photos.  We returned for the afternoon 3 pm feeding.  It wasn't as crowded.  A young orangutan was on the walkway putting on quite a show.  We saw more of these wonderful animals in the outdoor nursery and at the feeding platform in the afternoon.  Plan for plenty of time at the nursery as the orangutans are very entertaining."

Shortly before 10.00 we made our way to the feeding areas where the orangutans that have been released come in for food. We weren't disappointed. The orangutans came in from all directions including swinging on ropes over our heads!  Sadly our time was cut short as a 'rogue' orangutans, not one released  by the sanctuary, came in to feed, but he was rather aggressive and for our safety we had to leave."
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 6 February 2019,Couples,"I was a bit apprehensive to visit the sanctuary as I was expecting a zoo like facility. I could not been more wrong. The place is huge, thousands of hectares of land. No cages, no fences. Orang utans are free to come and go as they please. The only place with a building is the nursery where the babies are kept. But even there there are no fences. There are 2 feeding platforms where food is placed and then you need to wait and see if orang utans want to come and have some food. The animals are free so nobody can guarantee you will see them. We were lucky enough to see 4 or 5 in the feeding platform but the best was seeing more of them randomly sleeping or playing with their babies in the jungle. All we had to do was be patient and silent. Just don't follow the big group. Walk slowly and pay a lot of attention to your surroundings."

We went in at 0845 and was the first in queue. The ticket cost RM30 for foreigners and an extra RM10 If u have a camera. Phone camera does not count towards it. You can use the same ticket to come in again in the afternoon. There are 2 feeding times - at 10:00 and 15:00 where u can see the Orangutan (and monkeys!) at the feeding platform where the staff placed the food. We had to wait around 10 mins before the first Orangutan appeared. Subsequently few more joined including a monkey!Also beware that the nursery and feeding platform are 2 different places. We first head to the nursery at 0900 and around 0945, we started to walk towards the feeding platform. The staff only started to bring out the young Orangutan around 0930 at the nursery or perhaps it was raining that morning? After the feeding platform, we came back to the nursery again where more young Orangutan came out. The staff are very prompt in ‚Äúchasing‚Äù you out before 1200 and 1600 which are the closing times. At the end of the tour, you should spend 30 mins watching the documentary right next to the locker area, as well as the room next door which provides information of the rehab centre and few other animals the locals were helping to save. There are specific timings for the documentary. Overall, it‚Äôs a full day well spent and do allocate one day to visit both morning and in the afternoon. "

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 24 January 2019,Solo,"I visited this place and then returned two days later I was that impressed. The cost for an adult is 30 ringgit which works out at ¬£6. The feeding times are 10 and 3 and the centre is open for an hour either side of this. The centre is doing amazing work - taking in orphaned orangutans and rehabilitating them so they can be released back into the wild. They do the twice daily feedings to supplement their diet and also.to help them out if they are struggling to find their own food. When you visit you can go and see the young ones in the outdoor nursery where they are practicing their climbing skills. Once the keepers are satisfied they can cope, they are allowed to stay out at night. I saw some of the more confident ones swinging off into the trees and watched the staff trying to encourage the shyer ones to climb. Then you go to the outside platform for feeding. You need to remember these are not performing animals so you are not guaranteed to see them. I was lucky that a few showed up over the two days I visited (including a dominant male and a mum with a tiny baby). It was good that only a few came as it means the orangutans are doing ok for themselves. Walk slowly back and the keepers would point out ones that were up in trees nearby too. I can't believe people have given this place bad reviews as they weren't allowed to feed or touch the orangutans. These are wild animals not performing in a circus and these are exactly the type of people these magnificent creatures need protecting from.Keep up the amazing work SORC!"
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 21 January 2019,Couples,"We visited yesterday. First we went to the nursery. On our way there we already saw a wild orang-oetan! This was really amazing! It stayed in the jungle near the pathway for awhile and then it disappeared into the jungle. Near the nursery there was also a young one in a tree. The nursery was really great to see. The orang-oetans were really playfully and you could see them very clearly. We were just in time for feeding, which was also great to see. There was already an orang-oetan at the feeding platform before the feeding even started. It was just waiting for the food to be delivered. We could see it very clearly from the observation desk. After a while a lot of macaques also came to the feeding platform. There were pig-tailed and longtailed macaques. There were also a lot of babies with them. They were also nice to see, but the orang-oetan took some food and went to a quiet place in the trees nearby. We also saw a nice squirrel.We went back for the afternoon feeding session. On our way there we saw six wild orang-oetan!! We were really amazed! At the feeding platform there were already macaques. They were actually everywhere and also near the observation platform. One of the caretakers tried to scare them away. For this feeding session two adult orang-oetan were present and one baby! The baby was born in the wild they told us. So they are really doing a good job at rehabilitating the orang-oetan. When the feeding was almost done another orang-oetan appeared. He jumped onto the roof of the observation platform and went on to the pathway. It was really funny to see! Eventually he also disappeared into the jungle. For us it was an amazing experience! "
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 19 January 2019,Couples,"WOW what an experience we had here, had been reading the days prior to going that because it was fruiting season the chances of the Orangutans coming in for food was low, were told that that Semenggoh in Sarawak had been 2 months since they had seen one so I was prepared that we may not see any. However, on walking along the track 3 came from no where and climbed through the trees to meet us on the boardwalk, just wow, totally took my breath away to see them up so close. There are still wild animals so the guides were very strict on stopping and taking photos (you can take from a distant) or getting too close, one of them did try and grab a mans cellphone and the guy was very unimpressed with the tourist however it wasn‚Äôt this fault he was doing exactly as the guide had said, It did say however no cellphones allowed only cameras but this was not policed and everyone had cellphones, as a lot use them as their camera. We seen a total of 11 Orangutans including a wee baby swinging in the trees along with other monkies. The only suggestion was it was confusing where feeding was , we were taken to the nursery which wasn‚Äôt really a nursery as all Orangutans could come and go into the nursery it was fully pen, it appeared this was where feeding was so we waited but it was actually in the forest area and by the time we got there it was over, I‚Äôm not sure why they didn‚Äôt tell us we got to the nursery to make our way to the feeding area before 3pm.

We arrived prior to the opening time of 9am which gave us time to wander through the exhibition  (remove your shoes first) and learn more about the sanctuary and orangutans generally. Leave your backpack in the locker and head inside and pay your RM10 camera fee (mobile phones are free). You will head to the nursery first and watch the young ones playing around and get fed. If you are at the glass please sit down so those behind you can see! Then you will move to the feeding platform for the bigger orangutans where you MAY see some orangutans. On the day we went we didn't see any due to the rain (They don't like to be wet) but even if it's dry you may not see any if they are finding enough food by themselves (which is the whole idea of the sanctuary).

That is always the goal, and the large majority do eventually make it.We spent two full days there, and wished we had been able to stay longer. We began to recognise the individual orang utans, and their particular behaviour traits.There are no bars or fences, and they roam freely. Quite often wild orang utans come in from the forest and interact with them, which is a big plus in their rehabilitation.We found it simply enchanting, and one of the best 'attractions' ever on our travels.

The video explains what they do and it‚Äôs a must see.We saw orangutans at the feeding platform as well as loads of macaque monkeys, and many youngsters at the nursery area which you have to watch from behind glass which I have read some people have moaned about but they should be kept apart from humans to protect them, besides no matter how many signs there are about being quiet and staying sat down many people just completely ignored them.There is a small cafe and tiny gift shop. I normally avoid such gift shops but wanted to support the cause some more by buying something but there was nothing in the gift shop that said ‚Äòorangutan‚Äô, no mugs, soft toys, t shirts etc, they really need to look at their merchandise and think how much they could raise in funds through such things.

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 24 December 2018,Friends,"We are in Sepilok as I write this and have been to the sanctuary three times! Well, the deal is that if you go for the morning session at 10am your ticket allows you entry for the 3pm feeding time, and the price of 30MYR (non-Malaysians), it's well worth it, especially as we're staying a 15-minute walk away.So - what to expect. You will be asked to leave your bag in a locker (free), as there are naughty orangs and macaques who might just be tempted by your shiny camera or Gucci bag. Oh, and speaking of cameras, you will be charged an extra 10MYR for a camera (not a phone camera though), and a whopping 1000MYR (roughly 200GBP) if your camera has a lens of 400mm or more!There is quite a long walk from the entrance to the feeding station and as it' a wooden boardwalk can be very slippy after rain which we had in bucket loads last night.  The viewing platforms fill up very quickly, but it's quite easy to get a good spot to se the action. There is no guarantee you'll see orangs - we saw a horde of macaques and one orange this morning...two days ago we saw three orangs and no macaques. So, you might be disappointed - they don't perform on cue.Make your way to the nursery where there are two observation rooms where you may be lucky to see groups of infant orangs playing and feeding and having fun. It was hard to leave.Well worth the cost of admission."

On 1 occasion there were 3 mothers with their infants/babies.- Look up and around, whilst you are focused in 1 direction, there will be things happening above and to the sides and you will be the object of attention !We really enjoyed our time at the Sanctuary and were pleased to note that there has been effective success in releasing back to the wild those orangutans who are equipped to survive in the wild.

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 18 November 2018,,My goal in borneo was to see as many animals as i could!   We saw many in the wild but it was very special to get up close and personal and see them at the sanctuary.  We got there early and had a perfect view of the feeding station --where a mom and her baby came to feed and she kept all the others away until she was done.   There was a cute little guy who kept trying to sneak food and he was so cute and clever (hanging upside down to steal some food).   it was a really enjoyable experience...

There are plenty of opportunities to learn about orang-utans and watch how the young ones are taught to fend for themselves in the nursery.  I found it endlessly entertaining to see them interacting with each other and learning to climb and eat from the keepers, and also from older wild orang-utans that come in from the forest.  The personalities of each individual are so apparent and engaging.On the less positive side, if you're a serious photographer it's best to be aware that you'll have to shoot through very smeary glass at the nursery area (though this is of course to protect the orang-utans from human diseases so completely understandable). What I did take issue with is that the centre adds a 1000 ringgit (¬£200) fee for lenses of 400mm and over.  Even that's fine by me if it's implemented properly, but it's crazy as all the folk with super-zoom compacts just waltzed in without having to pay the fee - my partner had a 600mm F2.8 lens on a bridge camera that gives the equivalent of 900mm on my camera yet didn't have to pay! I found my 70-200mm was ok but missed the extra reach for photographing at the feeding station.  My advice is just go and really enjoy the experience and get your photos out in the wild!"

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 7 November 2018,,"This could be a your lifetime moment. I have visited here twice, Oct 2017 alone and summer 2018 with my family including 8 year old. Two important things to know before you go is the feeding time. For first timer, I suggest to go to the nursery in the morning. It is going to be a lot of people. Don't expect solitude. Expect to see young orang utans and possible moms with babies. However, it is not a guarantee you have an access to this place. Once, there was a wild orang utan lingered in the area. We were told he is violent and doesn't play the park rules. To ensure visitors safety, only small portion of this place was open for a few hours. For photography and possible more authentic experience (without glass walls) go to the second feeding platform. Afternoon is better since usually mornings are the busy time. Lots of tourist buses. Be there 20-30 minutes in advance to secure your spot and if you lucky enough, you possible able to see orang utans in action. Spotting is not guarantee. The weather is very humid.Based on my experience October is the best time to visit compared with August. Less people, hotel rate is cheaper and the weather is nice. I was told by the rangers, April is the most ideal time. In April, the forest doesn't produce fruits. It force the orang utans to show up for feeding time.There is a cafe near the entrance, basic local food. I suggest at least two days. This allow you to experience four times feeding. Travelers with young children and doesn't want to drive, I suggest to stay at the hotel within walking distance where you have an option to relax between the feeding hours. I hope this helps."

A special treat was to see an an orangutan walking on the handrail right past us and climb up to the roof of the shelter above us.The centre closes abruptly at 11.00am after the feeding and reopened at 2.00pm for the afternoon closing at 4.00pm. We went to the nursery at 2.00pm and as it was raining the Orangutan did mot want to play. They are as miserable as us when it is raining and the look on the face and gestures and body language says it all.We thoroughly enjoyed watching the young ones in the nursery and good that we went to the feeding in the morning as there where no Orangutan at the feeding platform in the rain that aftern. This is a testament to see that the Orangutan chooses not to come out that they can decide when and  where they will be in the sanctuary and sightings are not gauranteed. The rain stopped 5 minutes before closing and almost as a tease we saw an Orangutan come down to the platform just as we had to leave.This was a great experience and well worth the time spent to see these amazing creatures in a Sanctuary environment.

In all honesty we had the best experience of seeing wild orangutans as we were staying at the Sepilok Nature Resort, which is right next to the sanctuary. In the morning we had two orangutans walk down the paths in the hotel and onto our front porch, inevitably making a visit to the sanctuary not a necessary requirement. However if you want to learn about them and ask questions it's highly recommended. We didn't see any during the feeding time, maybe they weren't hungry, however saw some swinging on the nearby branches and also walking along the rails on the footpaths, which was really cool! The nursery is also cool as you can watch them play and swing about, along with the resident macacs. A power cut on the day spoiled the visit as we weren't able to watch the video which explains the work they do there and also the realisation about how palm oil farming has destroyed the population. Not sure why they don't have a power generator?  All in all, this is a worthwhile visit, especially if you've never seen the orangutans before, and it only costs ¬£4.20 at today's exchange rate! Can't complain with that! "

We spotted orangutans just as we started walking and you get to see the youngster feeding in one section and the adults in another . The feeding times are staggered so you can get to see the best of both .

You can take a bus from town for 6RM in the morning, however you will have to stay in the area the whole day if you want to bus back as it doesn't return until around 3.30pm otherwise it's taxi or hitch. No guarantee of seeing the animals - there was only one orangutan on the feeding platform while we were there. My recommendation would be to walk around the boardwalk while feeding time is going on as you might see more and avoid the noisy crowd - we were lucky enough to have some orangutan walk right past us. There are a few options for eating in the area. Still worth a visit. "

This place is too crowded, and the observation platform is tiny, considering how many people show up.  You have to get really lucky to see any orangutans because they'd have to be walking on the boardwalk. Definitely avoid the morning tours if you can, as that's when the hordes of day trippers show up.I'm giving it 3 stars because the nursery section is pretty entertaining to watch, although you have to do it from behind dirty tinted glass, so forget about taking quality photos."
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 7 October 2018,Friends,"First, please note this is *not* a sanctuary - it is a rehabilitation centre aiming to reintroduce orphaned, injured or displaced orangutans back to the wild in the adjacent reserve. Of course some animals will never achieve full independence and stay at the centre, but most eventually become integrated into the wild population in the reserve.The centre does amazing work, and visiting Sepilok was one of the main reasons I came to Sabah. Our group tour had limited time for our visit, but we were able to watch (from behind glass) young orangutans in the outdoor nursery and the morning (10.00) feeding of the older orangutans, both fascinating to see. We were also lucky enough to see an errant animal - closely shepherded by a ranger - walk past us as we went from the nursery to the feeding platform along the boardwalk.This was a fabulous experience, so do support our cousins at the Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre if you‚Äôre in Sabah - and if you can‚Äôt visit in person you can support the centre by adopting an orangutan!"

Both days were amazing and we saw multiple orangutans in different locations doing different things. On both days, we had orangutans walking down the boardwalk in front or behind us. This is just truly amazing to be so close to these amazing wild animals. There are carers / guards around the park keeping visitors at a safe distance from the apes. There is no forced interactions and the orangutans are left to be themselves. It was a truly amazing experience and a must see. "

We hired a car from Kota Kinabalu and drove to Sandakan stopping off for 3 nights. There are 2 feeding stations at the centre and several feeding times. One feeding station you are sat in a room with windows overlooking the feeding platform. The Orangutans know when the food is out and you see them swinging in from the trees...awesome! You are able to walk a little way through the forest to the second platform where you watch in the open. You are not allowed bags or food and drink in the forest to reduce the risk of tourists being attacked by the Orangutans or the nasty macaque monkeys who are always up for a free meal. You can walk round on your own or with a guide, we like to do things at our pace so never have a guide. Your entrance ticket lasts for the whole day therefore you can leave the centre after the morning feeds and return later for the afternoon feeds. I understand there were 49 Orangutans in that area and we saw loads. There was a naughty male Orangutan that attacked a female tourist whilst we were there, we didn't see what happened but I got a photo of the bad lad, he was determined to get someone lol. There is the opportunity to adopt an Orangutan, this costs ¬£36 without a cuddly toy or ¬£49 with a cuddly toy. You get information about the animal you choose, photos, a shopping bag and certificate. You can have it sent to any address.

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 4 October 2018,Couples,"There are several things that I wish we had known before the visit, I would like to share those for others and hopefully improve their experience.  We arrived at around 07:00 hrs and eventually realised that the cafe there is open, even at that time, so you can get food and drink.  They do excellent Malay food (all day) and a good old fashioned full English!  When the gates open at 09:00 hrs you will be prevented from taking any sort of bag into the park (as a safeguard to the animals - they tend to steal and  a bag may contain something injurious to them).  Be aware that bus tours tend to visit in the morning so it can get very, very, crowded. My main observation is that once in the park guests tend to follow each other like sheep and the flock tends to move quite quickly - we broke away from it to do our own thing.  The animals are in the forest around you at all times, so particularly towards feeding times they begin to congregate near the feeding stations.  Likewise after feeding they hang around for some hours and will leave and return to the area several times.  So, if you get to the feeding stations early and be prepared to hang around  after feeding, you will get a much better, uncrowded view of the animals.  Finally, we flew back to KK in the mid-afternoon.  Later we met people who had stayed-over in Sandarkan for the night.  They told us that that had given them more time to visit the bear sanctuary in the afternoon but also to do the night tour at Sepilok, which, we were told, was spectacular. We were also informed that the town is very lively and modern - bear in mind that in the old colonial times it was the capital of North Borneo as it was then called and so it has a lot of history.  So, in short, we would suggest that you give yourselves as much time as possible and avoid rushing about!"

She was behind the fence enclosing the entrance and was peering through at everyone. It was such a special moment to look into her eyes and know she was looking into mine! We walked back along the boardwalk and spotted an orangutan in the trees eating which was cool to watch. The feeding was a bit anticlimactic with mostly monkeys rather than orangutans. We did see a mother and tiny baby though which was cute. The feeding area viewing platform is shaded which is nice. Walking back along the trail we saw another couple of orangutans near the trail. We finished our afternoon back at the outdoor nursery watching the young orangutans playing. We were lucky to catch them being given baskets of fruit at about 15:30pm and it was amazing to sit in the air conditioned building and watch them interacting, playing and eating.The centre is great - they have free lockers for your bags. They even have some massive lockers which we managed to fit five suitcases and as many rucksacks into. At the end of the day it's easy to get a taxi or grab to the airport or back into town."

The hardwork put into rehabilitating the organgutans is fantastic. The centre opens at 9am and 2pm ready for the feeding times a little bit later on - 10am and 3pm. As the organgutans are semi wild you are not guaranteed for them to show up but I was lucky enough to see plenty of them feeding, particularly with a big male going aswell. Other primates are also around at feeding time. The feeding platforms fill up quite quickly so it's advisable getting there early to get a good spot. The organgutans can also be see around the centre as they are able to move around freely. The nursing station is also a nice area to watch the young ones playing and eating. Its also where the information is about the organgutans. There is a cafe however I didn't go to it so cannot comment."

A little scary but I've never seen such a magnificent creature and he really didn't have any interest in us. We saw so many adults and babies in the wild and in rehabilitation and they are some of the most amazing movers I've ever seen. Definitely a must see."

We saw a wild adult male and a wild female on the morning we visited.As there's no guarantee who will turn up at feeding time going both morning and afternoon gives you the best options. Keep watch on the walkway as well- we say a mother and baby just hanging out beside the walkway.A fantastic centre doing great work.

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 12 September 2018,Couples,"This has been number one on my Bucket List since Day 1 and it did not disappoint!We arrived at the Sanctuary at 9AM for opening and within 10 minutes we were greeted by our first infant Orangutan! Me being me, cried as I was swept up into the experience of it all as we saw our first Orangutan in what is essentially one of the only two countries in the world where you can experience these creatures in their natural habitat!We were free to roam around the Sanctuary for the first hour, wondering through the marked paths and visiting the Nursey where the baby / infant Orangutans played in their ape playground! 10AM was then when the first feed happened. The Sanctuary Rangers (What. A. Job!), brought baskets of fruit containing bananas, greens, melons and root vegetables up to the feeding platform where the Orangutans were free to come and go as they pleased. We saw a baby, a few adult females and also a large male with big flanges that the Rangers ran away from! As the Orangutans are ‚Äòwild‚Äô, the amount of them you will see per ‚Äòfeeding time‚Äô may vary. This can only be a good thing though, as if they are not returning to the Sanctuary for food, then the programme is obviously working, and they are off in the rainforest independently foraging for their own food. If you want the best view of ‚ÄòFeeding Time‚Äô, get there half an hour early as it can get slightly crowded and if you‚Äôre like us, this was the main event of the holiday and we wanted ‚Äòfront row seats‚Äô! (Side note, there are seats, but for the best view try the platform on the left that juts out slightly!)The Sanctuary then closes at 12PM for lunch (11AM on Fridays). This is a good time to get some food from the restaurant and go to visit the Sun Bear Conservation Centre (reviewed separately) which is right next to the Sanctuary. The Sanctuary then opens again at 2PM for the 3PM feed. The afternoon session was a LOT quieter than the first, so if you don‚Äôt plan on going for the full day, the afternoon might give you a nicer, less crowded experience. I would 100% advise not to go with a tour group however! The tour guides were very pushy and moved their groups on quite quickly, telling them to ‚Äòkeep on moving, and were in and out in no time. I do appreciate that it isn‚Äôt fair for the Orangutans to be surrounded by people, but I think this was more a timings thing more than anything! We paid the entry fee of 15RM and had the full day to ourselves. Our most magical moment with the orangutans happened when there were no other spectators with one Momma coming down from a tree and proudly presenting her baby to us in a ‚Äòlook what I made‚Äô fashion. I could have spent my whole holiday here, observing these beautiful creatures. Please do be respectful of the Orangutans though. The whole point of this Sanctuary isn‚Äôt for tourists to get photos ‚Äì it is to conserve these incredible animals and get them back out into the wild. By having masses of tourists surrounding them continuously, pointing cameras in their faces, is not preparing them for this. Put your camera down and just experience the wonderful moment!"

So many tourists are on private tours and leave as soon so they see the orangutans. We arrived about n hour after and there was about 15 people left. We had a slow walk around and a adult female and her baby walked right next to us on the path, absolutely amazing. We returned in the afternoon with the same entrance ticket and again arrived late, so many orangutans were around. Of you are going independently I would definitely recommend to go an hour after feeding time. Also we ended up chatting to a few volunteers and the work they are doing is brilliant! "

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 3 September 2018,Family,We had a fantastic time watching these wonderful creatures and their cheeky antics. After all this was one of the main reasons for our visit to Sabah. All the Orangutans have their own personalities and the staff know them all. You also sense they're passionate about the job they're doing and the whole sanctuary appears very well run. We used 'Grab' to get here and back at a cost off about RM25 each way and arrived for the 9am opening and feeding at 10am. Getting there early is recommended and we were lucky seeing so many Orangutans close up but there is an element of luck to the whole visit. Cost for overseas visitors is RM30 with an RM10 charge for cameras (SLR's etc not mobile phone cameras) Bags etc have to be stored in lockers as some of these guys are really good burglers! The Sun Bear sanctuary is just a short 5 minute walk away so we combined the two visits in the one trip out from town.
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 3 September 2018,Family,"Our family arrived just after the first of 2 feeding times for the day, (they are at 11am and 3pm) so we spent a few hours wondering around, reading up on the work they do, had a bit of lunch in the local caf√© (which is okay for a quick bite), visiting their playground area, and went to the Sunbear place across the road. It‚Äôs interesting enough and seeing the Orangutans is extremely cool, however, the highlight is feeding times where you can see them up close. However, be warned it‚Äôs not really a natural environment. I have many pictures of people taking many pictures while standing on a make-shift deck and it‚Äôs a bit of a push and shove to get to a spot where you can enjoy watching them. It got too much after about 20 minutes so we moved on. (or maybe we need to be an ultra-animal-lover). I‚Äôm glad we did it and we had a wonderful moment with an Orangutan where he came up really close to me and my son to say hello ‚Äì I think he felt sorry for us because we were on the outer a few steps away from the crowd! ‚Äì but I think without that experience, we would be a little disappointed."

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 26 August 2018,Friends,So so glad to support this wonderful centre. A must as well as the Sun Bear Centre. Travelling throughout Sabah and the endless sight of the Palm plantations it's plain to see how these animals are struggling to survive. Wonderfully run and an absolute joy to visit. Only negative was the lack of respect many other tourists showed by being SO noisy. It clearly asks for silence and yet this request is completely ignored by many people. I would have liked the staff to remind visitors and enforce this more to improve the experience for both other tourists and more importantly the Orangutans. The daily talk in the centre was worth seeing . Strangely the gift shop is rented by an outside company but the centre has a desk upon entry selling lovely t shirts which support the centre. 
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 25 August 2018,,"It's about 15-20mins outside of Sandakan and does get very busy with tour busses. Do take time out to visit this place. Spend time to take in the early morning video (get there for 8:50 to grab a seat or you'll end up perched on the floor). There are two morning feeds and these work very differently. We arrived late for the open air 10am feed. Whilst it meant we were at the back of a lot of people, we didn't miss anything. This one isn't that well attended by the Orangutan population, it's hot and sticky too. Better to head for the 10:30 feed that takes place at the activity (play) area. You can be seated indoors, it's 'L' shaped so try to walk straight ahead from entry point, rather than turning right (better view). Tiered seating but also space on the floor right up against the window. The latter being the best space for photos but obviously not for poor old knees and bum. The day we were there, there were two very early 'entertainers' (young orangutangs) with a few more following 15mins down the line. Great close up pictures and taking into account what you've just learnt from the video, you get a feel for how/why the rangers act with the animals.To help with funding, there's a shop on the way out (of course) but I can well recommend the polo shirts, good material, normal 'western' sizing, lovely design but equally a very good price."
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 23 August 2018,Couples,"We came for the orang utans and weren't disappointed! The entrance fee is not cheap for the region but when you consider it goes to rehabilitating these beautiful creatures it is more than worth it. The nursery has orang utans early in their rehab, where you will see them interacting with volunteers helping to train them for their return to the forest. There is lots of information around on each of them, as well as orang utans in general. The main attraction is definitely the feeding platforms for the orang utans late in their rehabilitation, where you will see them arrive from the forest, at 10am and 3pm. There are also other animals that may come, including the cheeky pig-tailed macaques and pygmy squirrels. The centre is very busy, especially in the morning. We felt the centre could benefit from capping the number of people allowed on the viewing platforms, as even though there was space and signs saying ""silence"" people were very noisy, and the staff didn't enforce the request. We felt this kept some orang utans away as only one came, and it was later at almost 4 o'clock (when most people had left!) that more arrived, including a mother and her baby! The afternoon feeding only runs until 4pm when the sanctuary closes. This is a shame as more orang utans were still arriving as we were told to leave, so while it was worth our waiting to try and see more we did't get to see them for long. We had an amazing visit, and it was definitely a dream come true. The only thing stopping this from being 5* was the noise, crowds, and early closing."

Also lots of staff members/volunteers walking around inside the area and holding hands with and dragging the orangutans back if they try to go too far away.. Seems more like a zoo. Went to 2 feedings = pretty much you and a hundred other noisy tourists standing around waiting for them to show up and eat fruit on a platform far away. The few orangutans who came didn't at all seem to enjoy the audience and turned their backs towards the crowd while eating and took off as soon as they were done. The whole thing felt very sad.. I know they're doing it for a good cause and are thankful that they at least have this area to live in, concidering the whole forrest is surrounded by palm oil plantations where the animals often get shot if they enter (by the farmers) they're pretty much trapped here and not so much free as it sounds. It's kinda too far off the beaten track to be worth visiting this place and you're really better off watching Discovery at home.."

The older orangutans were more sedate, one came to the feeding bench and collected bananas in  all paws and then carefully made his way back along a rope bridge to eat his bounty ....each paw held more delicious bananas! Made a good photo. The facility is well maintained and designed to manage the people flow...the only oversight is the gift shop....Some t-shirts but not all sizes and very little else.

It was extremely busy and many people have no respect for other tourists, constantly pushing in and speaking loudly and annoying everyone.  Very difficult to take photos as the light reflects from the glass but I worked out if you sit on the ground right near the glass it is minimised but be aware some tourists are still trying to push their way to the front.Intend going back hopefully outside of feeding hours when things are not so hectic.

It was really busy from 10am for about 45 minutes at which time the tours cleared out and very few people stayed. At one point it was just us and the orangutans. It was the same in the afternoon, though it was quieter in general after a little while the people cleared out and we had a peaceful viewing. It was truly an amazing day. Our top tip  would certainly be wait for the crowds to clear. Or go to the afternoon feeding if  only do one. "

The orangutan visit we did was afternoon feed- you walk through the jungle see great forestry and ferns plus insects, birds and monkeys all wild and in the trees. During our walk two friendly orangutan walked on the handrail right next to us (see pics) was only about 15 people around so very intimate and stunning animals!!We watched the nursery feed which was comfort and had air con. Fun to watch but very similar to a zoo environment with a screen and enclosure. We then went to the observation deck to watch the main feed which was cool. Some orangutan we‚Äôre feeding approx 10m away where they leave the food and one climbed on the roof just above guests and was peering down. Very fun but prepare for the feeding sessions to be busy and less intimate. Also visited the sun bear sancutuary which was disappointing as the enclosures meant you could only see bears from a real distance and we only saw two from far away. Nice canteen onsite with coffee available. Note cash is needed for almost everything. Recommend using or bringing insect repellent as you walk through the jungle. Would recommend. "

We went for the morning feed and arrived 30 minutes before the feed to get a ‚Äúplace‚Äù at the feeding platform. We were not lucky enough to see any orangutans on the boardwalk before the feed, and then none showed up to the feeding platform either (good sign for the rehab of these animals!). Although disappointing, I can‚Äôt imagine these animals coming anywhere near the platform with 150 people gathered around speaking loudly! We did see one orangutan on our walk around the boardwalk later, but being surrounded on both sides by 50+ people, the orangutan looked stressed and ill tempered. The movie was great and the nursery was nice with 5 little ones out for a climb and a play. This place is doing great work, but limiting the numbers of visitors or expanding the park and having two feeding platforms going at once would make it much better for the people and the animals! August is high season, so hopefully we just went on one of the busiest days and other times of the year are better. "

That being said, we saw loads of orangutans really up close both through the glass at the young orangutan centre and out in the wild. We'd really recommend getting there for first feeding as more orangutans come out around feeding time and it was much quieter than the peak tourist times later in the day. It was really relieving to go somewhere which is for orangutan conservation with a tourist element rather than exploiting animals just for tourists."

Having Arshad drive us meant we were able to visit what we wanted to in the luxury of our own vehicle keeping to our own schedule ...not being tied to set timings of a tour... and no visits to a ‚Äòhandicraft‚Äô place that you probably aren‚Äôt interested in.

We walked on the boardwalk but no orangutans were seen until we got to the nursery. The viewing rooms were already full but we observed the animals doing their thing on man-made structures  for about half an hour. Could have been in a zoo really. At 10.00 we walked back to the feeding platform where hundreds of people were waiting to see orangutans come to eat. The food was placed on the platform about 20 meters away and immediately some monkeys came and devoured most of it. After 45 minutes a small orangutan swung down to feed. That was the only one we saw.The money taken from tourists for this attraction could be spent on upgrading the boardwalk as it is rotten in places and slippery with moss.

The guides really do a good job and your entrance fee supports the good cause of saving the orangutans. However, it seems more like a money making machine and not a way of letting people enjoy the wildlife. Also, many of the tourists do not listen to the guides and get way to close to the wildlife and don‚Äôt keep quiet. Maybe there should be a limit to how many people can be let in every day? "

Have a BIG drink before you enter as it‚Äôs about to get hot, sweaty and thirsty. We spend our time split between the feeding platform and the outdoor nursery.

We were taken to the enclosure where the young orangutans were and sat inside behind sloping glass for the viewing. The reflection from the glass makes it difficult to photograph. We then proceeded to the viewing area where we waited along with about 70 other people all pushing to gain a vantage point to view the adults when they finally arrived. There is limited shade and it is very hot and we were not allowed to bring in any water and advised to be careful with hats etc as the Macaque monkeys can steal things from you. A disappointing viewing for us but we did realise that these are wild animals and not trained to perform for tourists.The Sun Bear area is a short walk from the Orangutans and also a disappointment.

You could watch for hours.Staff ensured observers kept away for the orangutans.If you want pictures take a camera with a decent telephoto lens. eg 200 -300mm but not too big as there are substantial charges for big telephotos. check before hand.No bags are allowed past the gate but lockers are provided. Wonderful animals and great to see them in the ""wild""."

We were sitting waiting for the film to start, when one of the British officianardos of the place stood chatting to us for 10 mins... got a great insight into the place ... We visited with a guide while staying at the nature lodge next door. We saw them feeding for a good 20 mins, was lovely, then went to the nursary, where the young ones were playing, but a large male made a rare appearance, which was so special... loved it. then on way back a troup of macaque monkeys crossed the board walk in front of us."

We flew into Sandakan from Kota Kinabalu but was not sure to expect when visiting the Sepilok Orangutan, Sun Bear Sanctuaries along with Labuk Proboscis Monkey Sanctuary. Arrangements had been made by our hotel in Kota to meet Taip Bin Halilol (Taxi driver) HP: +60142823373 at Sandakan Airport, who we could hire for the day and he would take us to the attractions of our choice. Taip arranged the  itinerary to make best use of the day and feeding times.Not only was his English language excellent but his knowledge of the area and wildlife first class. His rate for the day was very reasonable, far less then selecting a tour via one of the many operators offering similar day tours.He really made this day's experience the highlight of the holiday."

In event of such notoriety there is always a small element of coming away with disappointment when one makes their visit  to such venues. The latter could be because of high expectations or it being over rated by people who had nothing to compare it with.I am so pleased to report that it was as good as I had hoped for. It was plain to see that there is an earnest committment to the well being of the orang utans. The area was managed and kept well. It is a popular attraction and it cannot be denied that the people traffic was quite a factor to contend with. The exhibit for the nursery was quite well done. With the aid of a one way view glass front the ""babies"" did not seem overly bothered. However the viewing of orang utans on the  feeding platforms could perhaps be improved on. I know that what ever way one perceives it from, there can be no ideal way of making it as natural for the animals. Priorities need to be met and compromises made, have to be weighed against the benefits gained. I can only commend the management of the sanctuary for getting their priorities right and advocating for the orang utan rights too. "

To witness the antics so many little orphans playing, etc was quite surreal.  We were also fortunate to see a few of these inquisitive creatures at very close quarters as they walked along the elevated walkways.  We were also most fortunate to see a large wild male visit the rehabilitation feeding area on the first day and to then see him again just outside the feeding area on the second day of our visit.We were staying right next door which was fantastic as we were able to be there for both the morning and afternoon feeds of the orangutans, and were able to visit the Sun Bear Conservation Centre each visit too as it is right next door.  I would definitely recommend staying at Sepilok to visit these adjacent centres as they are an absolute highlight for any trip to Sabah, with both centres being so important for both research and education, and are an absolute must for any visit to Sabah."

You must visit the nursery, we sat,giggled and watched in amazement for hours. Feeding times for morning and afternoon feeds seemed to attract the orangutans equally when we went, however we spoke to others who said the afternoon feed was better. We heard stories about the orangutans being quite cheeky so ensure you keep hold of your valuables! Remember to have enough cash for the sanctuary as there is no ATM close (an 80RM taxi away)."

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 2 June 2018,Solo,"I visited as a solo independent traveller. I stayed 5 nights, arriving 7pm, and had 4 full days. Being independent I could spend as much time as I wanted and also alternate with the Sun Bear centre literally next door.I saw several tour groups at 9am most days, who watch an introductory video then go to the nursery and then feeding station for 10am. However the orangutans are in their natural habitat (this is not a zoo, as a lot of tourists thought). Therefore on a few occasions no orangutans came to the feeding station at 10am. I was able to stay on after the tour groups left, generally after 15 or 20 minutes. When all the 'crowds' had gone, the orangutans came down, so I had a personal show!!I spent a lot of time in the nursery watching the antics of the younger orphans. I was lucky enough to see the Alpha male who made a rare appearance, he was absolutely massive. Also spent time with rangers/keepers in the afternoons who knew where the likely spots were to catch a glimpse of some older orangutans in the tree tops.The frequent 'complaint' I heard form tour group members was that they didn't see many orangutans, in the very short period they were there. There is a cafeteria just outside. There are also free lockers near the video room. No food or drink in the sanctuary, water is OK. The sanctuary charge for cameras. They ask at the ticket office if you are taking photos. Show them your phone, if that is all you are going to use, as there is no charge. They charge ¬£2 for a standard camera. Some tourist had huge lenses and were charged much more.I adopted an orphan, and watched him play in the nursery. Hope to go back next year and also when he is ready for release into a protected area of the rainforest once he has learnt all the necessary skills to survive.Thoroughly recommend a visit but certainly better as an individual, rather than part of a tour group limited on time."

Somewhat surreal as we were there to see the orangutang but just proves the free movement of the wildlife of the area.  We went to the morning feed.  We were a little late as the feeding had just started.  There were so many people, and a lot of them were part of large groups.  There was one large male orangutang feeding and we were told that as a male had turned up it was unlikely that any others would come to feed.  After 15 minutes or so the male orangutang left and the big groups of people got bored and moved off to see the babies being feed.  DON'T DO THIS if you feel you can wait it out!!!  We had the most amazing experience when the crowds left and only half a dozen of us remained; the female orangutang came to feed as it was quiet.  We were on the boardwalk and two females, separately, walked within a meter of us on the boardwalk handrail to get to the feeding platform.  We had guides urgently whispering not to look into the eyes of the females and move slowly as it would be seen as aggression as they passed so close if I reached out a hand I would have touched them.  Truly one of the most amazing experiences ever!  They were so near you could feel the power of these beautiful creatures."

Both times we only had 3 orangutans visit the feeding platform, but the afternoon visit was much more entertaining with a huge alpha male, a female who decided to make her way through the crowds, which was met with a mixture of both delight and fear by everyone, and another, smaller male who so wanted a banana but was too scared of the alpha male so he would be swinging from the trees getting a little closer each time.  In the end the alpha male chased him off! There was also a cheeky macaque monkey who kept trying to get a banana but the alpha male would hit him every time he got near.The morning feed also had a lot more people, although we still had a good view of the feeding platform.My recommendation would be to try and visit both feeding times if you can as we had two very different experiences."

It felt quite secure and our belongings were fine afterwards and ultimately its for the good of the orangutans. We watched as the Orangutans swung to the platforms just prior to feeding - it was surreal. We loved that they were not in enclosures and were free to roam and come as they pleased and sat there just watching them come and go for an hour. Surprisingly we didn't find there was too big of a crowd and it felt rather intimate.We then wandered to the ""nursery"" where we sat in air conditioning behind a large glass panel and watched 10 orangutan babies play, forage and swing around in their jungle gym. Again, they were free to disappear into the trees as they pleased and we learned that in time, they will do so and perhaps never return. The only reason we didn't give a 5/5 for this experience was the missed opportunity for public education. The information hall held dreary posters and information decades old and we felt a lot more could have been done to educate people on the devastation of deforestation (namely palm oil) and hunting. We were so happy with what we witnessed we didn't return for the afternoon feeding-  but were told our ticket purchased that day would have still gained us access."

From the infant nursery where the babies played and frolicked to the young adult platforms kept us amused for hours. The boardwalk for each area is safe and well maintained. The rainforest is just amazing. To stand still and listen to the sounds of the jungle is also amazing.The price to,enter is minimal and well worth doing.The orangutans are free to swing through the jungle and if you are lucky enough, as we were, they may even come down to the bosrdwalk and walk along the railings before sitting and allowing for many photos and video to be taken, Our time here certainly ticked all the boxes on our list."

Its well laid out, and behind the areas of forest you see is 400 square kilometers of sanctuary for the orangutan. you view the young orphans behind soundproof tinted glass (so you do not imprint on them) and then at a feeding platform you can get to see the bigger animals. We had to wait for 40 minutes to see an animal arrive (because they are not starving and dependent on it) The sanctuary has been going since 1964, has released over 300 animals back into the ever depleting forest of Borneo. Its clean, natural and a beautiful walk."
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 25 May 2018,Couples,"The Sepilok Orang Utan Sanctuary was included in Abai & Local Touch tour, so we had a guide with us to provide information which was useful.  It's worthwhile looking at the video presentation about the Sanctuary and its rehabilitation programme held in a small conference room just outside the entry (about 20minutes).  We were able to see a number of younger orang utans from the enclosed viewing platforms at the nursery area (Stage 1 rehabilitation area).  The viewing platforms are behind tinted glass walls, so the orang utans are not disturbed by the hosts of tourists.  The orang utans here are usually orphans that are learning natural skills normally taught by their mothers by a ""buddy"" system.  We saw lots of amusing antics by these precocious young apes.  Viewing is good but reflections on the glass can make taking photos a bit difficult.  The open viewing platform in the Stage 2 rehabilitation area is better for photos but when we were there only a couple of orang utans were in the vicinity and only one came down to the feeding platform (this area is more forested and the orang utans are foraging in the forest so may not come in at the regular feeding time).  Once fully independent the orang utans are released back into the wild.The Sanctuary is providing a very worthwhile purpose of rehabiliting orphan orang utans to the wild."

It involves walking through tropical foreat which can be very hot and humid. However catching sight of one of these magnificent creatures makes it worthwhile.  In the nursery unit you can see very young apes practicing their hanging around and climbing skills. It can be very crowded near the feeding station(Humans not apes!) and it is not guaranteed they will turn up as they are wild creatures. We were lucky!

We also saw a documentary on the work carried out at the Sanctuary.A wonder of a place, it is so sad that the dreadful destruction of the Borneo Forest by the Palm Oil Plantations have put these most wonderful animals at risk.A must to visit.

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 15 May 2018,Friends,I was worried that this would seem a bit zoo-like but it feels more a semi-wild experience. Our group went to both feeding times - 10am and 3pm. We didn‚Äôt see anything at the morning feed apart a long-tailed macaque stealing all the food but the afternoon feed was magical. Four adults and a toddler came for their food and a play and watching them swing down through the jungle onto the platform was a very special moment. If it wasn‚Äôt for the other 150 or so people it would definitely feel like watching animals in the wild. Could have stayed to watch them all night! Definitely a ‚Äúmust see‚Äù.

But of course the orangutans are the stars. The morning feeding is quite busy as many day tours start here before going to other sanctuaries. If you have time, it‚Äôs well worth going to both feeds as the second one was far less crowded - we also were very lucky in that an orangutan came down onto the walkway and got within 2 metres!

The morning visit included their video and explanation of what and why they are doing the work. Fascinating and well worth seeing. We then walked into the sanctuary proper and waited near the feeding platform - we were not disappointed - a semi wild male visited unexpectedly together with a mum and baby. They were later joined by three other young Orang-utans and it was fascinating to watch the interaction. On the night walk we were guided by James - a senior ranger who teaches the baby Orang-utans to climb trees. He has been there since the 70s and was incredibly knowledgeable. It was a brilliant experience. This is an interesting conservation project and well worth a visit. "
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 11 May 2018,Couples,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the sanctuary. It was a different experience to the one at Semenggok, Here we started with visiting the area for juvenile orangutans. Here you see them through glass so they are less aware of their human observers. We saw around  8 orangutan here, together with some visiting macaques who didn't want to miss out on some free food! it was wonderful to watch their natural behaviour - playing, playfighting, eating. We then walked to the second feeding station which is open to the elements. Two orangutans were making their way in but then the heavens opened and they retreated high up in the trees, hiding beneath the branches. As the rain persisted they didn't come any closer which was a shame. Again, two macaques took advantage of the situation and filled their cheeks to bursting with fruit. We decided to move onto the Sun Bear sanctuary but thankfully the ticket for the Orangutan sanctuary lasts all day so we were able to return later in the day and saw far more orangutans which was wonderful. We were staying at the nearby Sepilok Nature Resort but had still taken a knapsack with us with everything you might need for a day out. However you can't take anything in with you other than your camera and a hat or coat so we had to leave our knapsack in a free locker room. This wasn't a problem but we wouldn't have taken so much if we had known in advance. Also, you do have to pay for a camera pass to take photos (this does not apply to mobile phones). We returned to the Orangutan sanctuary to do a guided night walk which was  wonderful. We saw a yellow banana snake, various frogs of different sizes, spiders, sleeping birds (very cute), fireflies, millipede, stick insects, small scorpions (hiding in the handrails and behind bark on trees). For us the highlights were watching flying squirrels, gliding between trees high above us and a cheeky orangutan who decided to accompany us. The ranger kept shooing him away but if he thought no one was looking he would start to creep forward - either through a succession of forward rolls, or by crawling towards us on his stomach or by walking, waving his arms high above his head. He reminded me of a sulky adolescent - unhappy not to be the centre of attention as the flying squirrels were getting that at the time. It was an excellent experience, which we would highly recommend. There are toilet facilities at various points within the site and a small cafe."

You can't touch them, or get too close to them.  You can't make them appear at feeding time if they don't want to.  It's about understanding the dedication and work that goes into preparing these animals for a life where they don't depend on humans - and we are privileged to get an opportunity to see what goes on - we can look at the young apes from behind glass and watch them play and interact with each other, and we can stand at a distance and observe older ones come to eat on a platform, if they want to.  If you're interested in conservation work, and want a chance to catch a glimpse, don't hesitate, it's an incredible opportunity - but don't be disappointed if you can't pick up a baby orangutan."

4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 5 May 2018,Couples,"The Sanctuary is only opened twice a day, morning and afternoon. It is closed during lunch time. This cannot be verified, but appearance of the orang utans at the Sanctuary is dependent on the fruiting season in the jungle. When there is an abundance of fruits in the jungle they would not bother to come to the Sanctuary for the free fruits. This could be the reason why visitors sometimes do not see any orang utans in the sanctuary during certain periods of the year. I have been to this place twice. This time there were many orang utans in comparison to the first time when I was there, when there were only three orang utans roaming around. Do not forget to visit the orphanage at the Sanctuary, there are many younger ones that are kept there till they are deemed to be independent enough to be released into the wild."

Lucky for us we had timed our visit with a feeding session. Not sure if you would see any orangs or macaques at other times.  It was fascinating to hear them crashing through the trees as they approached the platform. Watching them eat the fruit was also fascinating with many choosing not to look at us humans while they ate.After they'd had their fill they slowly moved off back into the jungle.So sad to think how little of their habitat is left thanks to the insatiable need for palm oil.Dont forget your hat, bug spray and water.

We visited several times on this trip, and on one occasion didn‚Äôt see any orangs at the feeding platform. A bit disappointing but it‚Äôs great to think that they don‚Äôt have to come to the platform for food since they have settled well into the forest. If I have one concern about this place it‚Äôs the behaviour of some of the visitors.Orang are shy animals, there is no wonder they don‚Äôt come when you hear the noise from the people at the platform.Having said that it‚Äôs a great place to visit, and if you stay in the area sign up for the night walk.

On one side they had the nursery where 4 young orangutans were able to play and learn before release. The main viewing is behind glass so as not to disturb the orangutans too much. However, the orangutans could wander where they liked and one came very close to the walkway so we had a really good view. The ranger ensured everyone was safe. On the other side there‚Äôs a feeding platform which provides wild orangutans with free food. Here there is no real barrier between you and orangutans. The orangutans wander in from the rainforest as they like. There are ropes overhead so they swing right over you. A great experience the kids will never forget. Perfect photo opportunity. While we were there two large groups of macaques arrived to also feed. It was a great experience to watch. At night we returned for a guided night walk. It was fantastic!

At the sanctuary , they  feed them boring food  to  try to encourage the orangutans to find their own more interesting food themselves so the rangers see it as successful if you actually don't see any Orangutans other than in the wild. It would be really disappointing if you didn't see any  however there is a very good video they have made which is a must to view. When you arrive you check your bags into a free locker as no food or sunscreen, insect repellent   can be taken into the sanctuary. It is very hot standing on the walk way so drink heaps of water before you go out. There is a cute cafe selling breakfast, drinks  and snacks. We also saw the sun bears and later we drove back out to similar area to see Proboscis monkeys ( don""t miss them) after lunch  but I could not understand why we didn't do all three in morning then drive into Sandakan  for the rest of the tour, we spent to much time in the van"

We arrived early because our flight from k.k came at 7.3p and we had breakfast at the cafe (Very very average) and while we were waiting to orangatans jumped up on the office block and hung around.  The rangers weren't happy. And took them by the hand marching them off  them off growling at them.  I thought they were there on their own free will and if they want to hang around the office they can!! Anyway we also saw 2 play fighting ..but the rangers were really uptight about them shooing everyone away.  The feeding time we only saw one.   So it's hit and miss .

To watch the 3-5 year olds come into the play area for food was quite emotional, knowing that they were wild and making their own choice to be there. You view them from as seating stand behind huge windows, looking down on a play area for them , alongside the jungle.Their keepers minimal interaction helps them to grow and learn to Orangutans again, after some have learnt to be human during their abuse while small babies when taken from mothers. This amazing sanctuary allows them to grow and live in peace, learn and enjoy life once more. The older ones may visit the feeding station, the baboons and many other animals to see in the jungle. Saw miniture and large squirrels, bugs, etc.  A MUST SEE."

However we managed to catch a very upclose moment with one of the orangutan which was so much fun. Nevertheless it was a worthwhile experience. Having always seen the orangutan behind glass or bar, seeing them roaming free and how they should be brings joy. The place is kept extremely well and you could just sit there for hours being surrounded by lush tropical greenery. No bags or backpacks are allowed in. If you must bring, there are lockers prepared to store them for free. Would advise to plan your travel time right and to not miss the feeding times. Just Google the centre and you'll find all the information needed about the centre. Getting there was pretty easy. We booked a Grab from Harbour Mall to the centre and it cost RM22 one way. Travel time around 30 minutes max. Heading back to town was easy too. We just Grab back.While you're at the centre its also worth mentioning to drop by the Rainforest Research Centre which is just 1.5km from the Sepilok centre. But do remember to wear proper shoes. "

We flew at 6.20am and our private guide was waiting at Sandakan. We went for the first feeding and didn't see any Orangutans so we were able to come back for the afternoon feeding....so glad we did as we were able to watch them for over an hour. IT was quieter as no tours go in there in the afternoon. We watched the orphans in the nursery as they played. It was definitely worth paying extra for a private car as we could decide on the day."

We arrived to the centre in the morning and watched an informative film about the great effort of the rehabilitation of these precious apes. Afterwards we experienced the plat form feeding at 10 am. It was pretty crowded already. There are 2 feedings a day, at 10 am and 3 pm. The morning feeding tends to be be more tour- group heavy, so preferable to watch the afternoon feeding. I absolutely loved to watch these amazing, intelligent and charming creatures. ""Orangutan"" means ""Man of the wild"". However, as a nature- and animal lover, it's truly sad that sanctuaries like these have to be set up to help orphaned and injured orangutans. But all my respect for the dedicated people working here :):) It was so adorable to watch the abandoned babies in the outdoor nursery. Inside the centre you'll also find Borneo Sun Bear Conservation Centre.Highly recommended!"
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 21 April 2018,Couples,"The 'rehabilitation ideal' was the reason to visit; imagine a zoo without a rear property fence. Once the orangs are raised and/or rehabilitated they are free to return to the wild. While this creates a problem for the viewing visitors, the center also serves as an education primer before striking out to chance a sighting in the wild. During feeding time in the juvenile area there were plenty of adorable orangs, on the main feeding platform there was one older female. This was a positive really as it meant the mature animals are adapting and eating on their own, especially during fruit season in the surrounding rain forest. The facilities are minimalist for visitors as it is a charity based organization. Educationally prepared us for our adventure in the wild, where we had 12 sightings from the Sukua Lodge area. Easily accessible from Sandakan, Sabah. We visited on a private tour but public buses are available from town. Requires about 2-3 hours for a visit, a little longer if you visit the adjacent Sun Bear Center. Admission is 30RM (plus a 10 RM camera fee (about 10 USD) per person. Viewing is done on an elevated walkway and from a glassed in viewing area. We also saw other monkey species on our visit. Highly recommend using this as a primer for the conservation effort and learning everything orang utan before heading out into the wild of Sabah. IMHO if this was your only viewing opportunity you missed some great adventures in the rainforest. Having a guide was also very helpful as his knowledge and insight were very keen. Bring an umbrella, great for rain and the tropical sunshine as this is primarily an outdoor activity."

Then the morning feeding time was very busy/noisy so only smaller monkeys came out but if you wait until everyone goes then the orangutans come. The afternoon feeding time was quieter and so better too. Lucky to see the male orangutan and also two on the walkway!The video was also informative and interesting.Only strange thing was not being allowed water inside but I assume there‚Äôs a good reason.Also cafeteria does good cheap food!
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 20 April 2018,Family,"We were advised to avoid the weekend when visiting Sepilok, so we decided to go on a Monday. The crowds were crazy even on Monday morning, so I can't imagine how busy it gets on weekends.The ticket allows entry for the whole day, so you can come back for the afternoon feeding which is apparently less crowded as fewer tour groups attend according to our driver. We didn't have time to come back however so I can't confirm this personally.If you go early they advise you to visit the nursery, it was nice to see the young orang utangs playing but you feel like you are the ones in a cage, so seeing them on the feeding platforms is much better.Many of the coach tours didn't give their groups much time though, as they started to leave only a few minutes after the orang utang showed up. I heard a few of those groups complaining as they were being lead out saying they only managed to a get a couple of photos, but the drivers kept going. Something to keep in mind if you're thinking of joining a coach tour.We hired a driver for the day instead, Mr. Arshad who was excellent so we went at our own pace.

We included this as part of a week long itinerary organised by our local guide Joe Harry (Zahari) from Tours By Locals (look him up, he is fab!!) and he was invaluable, even at Sepilok as he recommended the afternoon session. Apparently there had been heaps of tourists at the morning and no Orangs (which is actually a good thing as it means that they are finding ample to eat in the jungle) but I can understand it would have been disappointing. To be honest though, we had just as good Orangutan sightings at the Rainforest Discovery Centre (highly recommend it) and when we were there there were no tourists either, thanks to Joe's tips."

It's the safest place for them away from palm oil disasters. There's a lot of them though, and they are very calm, shy, beautiful creatures.

Please support these guys with their work - they're saving some of the most beautiful animals on the planet who are 99% like us humans.Staff are helpful, place for holding your bags in the lockers.

In the morning feed there were no organ utans (which i thought was a good sign as they are not dependand on being fed) on the afternoon feed we saw 6 orang utans. There are no fences which I like so they can roam if they wished, only let down is allowing big groups of school children in at the same time as they're noisey and in considerate to the animals. Also I find it ironic that the cafe onsite sells snacks containing palm oil.  "

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 15 April 2018,Friends,"So I went to the Sepilok Orang Utan Sanctuary with a friend, and we had a great time.Unfortunately we arrived the same morning as a cruise ship, so there was probably a thousand people there for the morning feeding, which was annoying and meant that no one got to see anything very well. However, we hung around until the cruise ship people left, and wandered the sanctuary and got to see a lot more orang utans chilling out in the trees, playing, and having fun. The nursery area was also very cool, and we got to see lots of young orang utans during the feeding time there. My advice is to plan to spend a few hours here. Although you can do the whole thing in probably 30 minutes, you‚Äôre going to get the most out of the experience if you take some time to chill out on the pathways, talk to the guides, and give the orang utans some time to make their way around the sanctuary so that you‚Äôll hopefully have more viewing time. Pro tip: you can‚Äôt take anything into the sanctuary (no bags, bottles of water, etc.) so when you arrive go straight to the bag check and leave your stuff. It will get you ahead of the line of people who don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on and try to bring their stuff in anyway."

On our second visit there was an extremely large contingent of cruise ship visitors, however we had found from our first day that once people had taken their pictures they quickly moved on and were priviledged to spend nearly 40 minutes with just 8 other people watching a mother and her young baby. Yes it can feel a bit touristy but in order to maximise your experience, don't follow the crowd - as we were walking out we noticed a young orangutan in a tree only a few feet right above us, casually munching leaves - memorable!"
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 13 April 2018,Couples,This was one of the main highlights of our entire trip.  Seeing these amazing animals in a natural habitat is just a brilliant experience.  We stayed locally so went for both the morning and afternoon feeds.  In the morning the orang-utans stayed away but there were lots of macaques which were fun to watch.  The morning feed is a bit of a cattle market of bus loads with lots of (very noisy) children.  Orang-utans are notoriously shy and stayed away - I reckon due to the noise which was unbelievable - children screaming and running around (despite the signs asking for silence so as not to scare the animals.  The guides did nothing to control this and this was a bit disappointing.  The afternoon feed was much better with less people.  Three orang-utans turned up - 2 females and a baby which was just amazing.  Definitely go for the afternoon feed.

Payment for the ticket covers you for the whole day. The morning session was disappointing although watching the babies in the nursery being taught to climb was fun. It is a pity that the glass makes it difficult to take photos but moving around to try to avoid reflection helped. The afternoon was much more successful although some people (including a tour group) had already left before the orangutans arrived.First one, then another and then a mother and baby which was wonderful to see. A visual demonstration of the sexual habits of orangutans was a bit more than I had planned for, I have to admit, however watching people's faces was rather amusing.Something that should be made clear is that this sanctuary is cash only, no drink bottles or bags in general are allowed. Not unreasonable given that monkeys have been know to grab them but perhaps it would be better advertised at the main entrance rather than just as one walks in.

There is a new nursery building where you can watch the youngsters playing and being fed outside. We were seated in an air conditioned   glass fronted building. The one way glass means the orangutans cannot see you. They are very cute but it is difficult to get good photos through the glass. The old outside feeding platform and viewing decks are still there and they feed these slightly older orangutans twice a day a little earlier than the nursery so you can see both. The great thing about Sepilok is that they really do return the orangutans to the wild. The other fantastic thing is that it is only 15 minutes drive from Sandakan Airport.

Did not see a single ape during both, which was not a problem for us as we took this to mean that they forage in the jungle and this is a good sign. We then went to the outdoor nursery where you can watch the young ones (and the older ones who choose to drop by from the surrounding forest) feeding and playing which was very entertaining.What really spoiled it for us was that at 10 minutes to four you basically get kicked out (we had just come in at 3 o'clock). They tell you that the apes go to sleep now even though you could still see them playing outside. We got the impression that the staff were eager to clock off and go home. The entire time we were there no one ever told us anything about the apes or the project. They just watched you and made sure you got out as quickly as possible. I guess this is due to the fact that they are all employed by the center (or possibly the state?) and are paid no matter what they do. Other visitors that afternoon had the same feeling.So if you are keen on contributing to the Orang Utan Rehabilitation, do go. If you want to meet passionate people in a great conservation project visit the Sunbear Conservation Center right next door. Our kids loved it so much they offered to give up some of their allowance for the sunbears!"

The sanctuary is designed with their needs paramount, but the setup of the feeding platforms (plus the tendency of some of the younger orangs to hang out people-watching on the boardwalk) means that it is possible to observe these beautiful creatures at close quarters. An experience not to be missed."
3.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 18 March 2018,Solo,This is one of the main reasons why I came to Malaysia. Maybe because it is bad timing. It is the fruiting season. Which means that there are plenty of fruits they dont need to depend on the food at the feeding station. Each time there was feeding I only saw one coming to feed. The outdoor nursery was also a big disappointment. I though you could walk and be close to them. But instead you are inside a glass building and taking photos behind the glass is not possible given the glass has lost its transparency and its like shooting with your camera by covering your lens with clingfilm. There is NO MORE after the feeding station and outdoor nursery. I think I was expecting more. Maybe seeing workings handling baby orangus. I asked and apparently there are not many inside. They had about 8 baby ones which is not open to the public. So the scale is a lot smaller than I imagined. Still it is the first time I have seen an orangu ever. And I saw it in the semi wild at the feeding station so Im happy. Maybe I had unrealistic expectations. Like being a David Attenborough sitting next to a mummy gorilla with her baby gorilla haha.

Yes, you look through glass but the people are confined & the young ones are outside learning to be a orangutan, great fun.  We were there a long time & watched as one youngster did not want to go in so provided more entertainment as the minders tried to coax her in.  We were back in the afternoon, no show at the feeding platform but there were more youngsters out that did their thing for an hour or two for us & we stayed till they told us it was closing time at 4 pm.

Somehow there is a feeling of shortcoming and anti-climax to the whole experience. Understanding that the jungle behind the sanctuary is huge and the wild orangutans are free to come and go as they please, there is very limited sightings except for feeding time. Even that, there are only a few stragglers so don't get your hopes up. The nursery area is well laid out with one-way glass panels so you can watch the young ones on the jungle-gym without them being aware of you. However, it was stuffy and hot as the air conditioning was faulty. The efforts for the sanctuary is great but may lack support from the government to make it exceptional and educational.

Within 10 minutes of arriving, a number of different Orangutans had already walked within cm of us with nothing separating us from them which was a brilliant experience that sets the heart going. Throughout the day their are also a number of different feeding times in which you are almost guaranteed to see the Orangutans being fed. In addition to seeing them up close, their is also a building in the middle of the jungle which contains a practise play area for all the younger monkeys which can be viewed from different platforms inside the building. Although the centre is good, unless you are devoted to Orangutans, I would maybe suggest combining a trip to the centre with a trip to the Sun Bear Sanctuary in the same day which are located across the road from each other."

The walkways take you through some amazing rainforest to the nursery and onto a feeding area where you will usually get to see some of the Orang-utans come for some fruit, however, if it is raining, there might not be any (like humans, they don't always like going out in the rain). If you're lucky, you will see some on your walk through as some of us were lucky enough to. Well worth visiting. You can either arrange a tour through an agency or your hotel, or hire a taxi and include the Borneo Sun Bears next door.

So with this in mind we find it worth supporting.We did though miss information on how reintroduction takes place, and how and when they have actually happened. It‚Äôs worth visiting if one passes by, but not worth a dedicated tour - unless of course seeing orangutan is a priority for being on Borneo - we would recommend rather finding a outfitter / guide service and go into the jungle.

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 18 January 2018,Couples,"The Sepilok Orangutan Center was a controlled, humane way to interact with wildlife in my view. The staff are very friendly and informative and keep an eye out for cheeky monkeys. They also serve as 'monkey markers' by standing wherever an obscured orangutan is so that they can show tourists and tell them about the orangutan. There aren't scads of them running about in the woods like people might expect at a wildlife center. The ones we saw were few and far between (apart from during morning feeding time and at the nursery, where a few monkeys are in the early stages of rehabilation and stick to a confined area).Before entering, you put all of your belongings in a public locker space with a generic padlock. In other words, make sure to pack lightly and leave any valuables oher than what you'll need for the day (i.e. camera, phone, cash to get by) at home/ in your hotel. The lockers are to ensure that the monkeys don't take your belongings, as some of the monkeys are quite cheeky and will take whatever looks shiny or important.Also before entering, you purchase a ticket for entrance and for any cameras you will be using to take pictures (except smartphones -when we went, they didn't charge tourists for bringing in smartphones - but you might want to confirm this). The Center itself is quite nondescript, with wooden walkways around the majority of the viewing areas. Be sure to wear shoes with grips if its rained, or if it is raining, as the paths can be quite slick. Like most nature parks in Southeast Asia, there are fewer protective measures on the guard rails, so be careful not to drop anything, as it could easily slip out the bottom and into the ecosystem upon which the countless animals that live and visit the resort depend on for food. Use common sense and good shoes, and you should be fine.The animals really are an amazing sight to see - they are very expressive, but you might need a good camera to capture their human-like expressions, because you can't be sure they'll be up close. We saw a baby, daddy, and momma monkey during morning feeding time, and a dejected, unrelated female that was clearly too shy to go near the close knit family while they were eating. Overall, good experience, but surprised that this was the more popular of the two conservatories in the cul-de-sac, as the sun bear center across the road was a more intimate glimpse into endemic Borneo wildlife. Glad we went.Tip: afternoon feeding had much fewer orangutans than the morning feeding. If you have to choose, go for the morning feeding. They monkeys are smart and know that in the afternoon, they only have to wait an hour before visitors leave so they can enjoy their dinner without spectators. This was our theory on why there were so few monkeys at afternoon feeding, anyways!"

We saw the 'third' nursery where young orangutans learn to socialise and play with each other away from the human carers who've looked after them up to this stage. The first  nursery, where young infant orangutans are fed and carried, and the second nursery, where these orangutans are taught how to climb etc under the close supervision of their human carers, are not visible to the public eye, so you don't get a chance to see the cute young orangutans. However, it's still great seeing them play as they're a little older and also eat the various fruits given to them. There are two feeding sessions where visitors get to observe and take photos of orangutans on a platform. We were explained by our guide that the goal of the centre is to rehabilitate the orangutans back into the wild, so they are fed a diet of mostly bananas in the hope that they become bored and want to venture out into the wild in search of a more varied diet. Hence, during feeding time, the less orangutans that come, the happier the carers are, as it means that they are closer to being released into the wild. Therefore, even though we only saw one orangutan during the feeding session, it was comforting to know that the others are one step closer to going 'home'. Overall, a great place to see orangutans up close, especially as it's so hard seeing them in the wild. However, don't expect to see the young ones, as your expectations will be sorely dashed."

This was a dream come true for me to see the ‚Äòman of the forest‚Äô in their original habitat. Well worth a visit.

The jungle has plenty of very old trees which in themselves are worth looking at and asking the guide about. A managed facility and we saw three orang utans in the nursery but unfortunately none at the feeding platform on the day we visited but as the guide had said in advance it really is pot luck. 
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 6 January 2018,Friends,My main goal was to see an orang utan and we did see one. I didn't realize it was rainy season and that affected the wildlife so seeing one was great. I visited in Jan and apparently rainy season can last late Nov to Mar. You can't control the weather and have to roll with what you get. I still enjoyed the sanctuary and was happy to get the chance to see one. Walking thru the jungle is interesting and you get too see some cool insects flowers and lots of birds. You might want to bring binoculars and be prepared to pay extra to use your digital camera. I don't know why but it costs a little more 10 myr.

You are able to see the orangutans and gibbons traverse down ropes from the jungle to a feeding platform.  The trick is to catch them at the two feeding times each day.  Please note, it is not a guarantee you will see them if they decide not to make an appearance.  We had to visit twice as the first time, they did not appear."

While I was there for a 10 a.m. feeding, there were no orang utans at that time (good that they are foraging and finding their own food!) and there were a lot of people.  A pig tailed macaque showed up and ate some of the fruit.  Later, however, when most of the people were gone, two orang utans arrived and another was swinging on the ropes and vines behind the viewing area. It's great to see the young ones playing in their play yard as well. The informational talk by a British volunteer before walking around inside the center was also interesting. Be prepared to carry nothing into the reserve except your camera. There are free lockers for the rest of your belongings."

The nursery area is sooo cute and I could have spent hours watching the playfulness of these young Orangutang's  - the lovely thing is they are in a great big natural open area and we were in a glass box watching them - although the sweat was dripping of us..!! I think there was a problem with air con.  It wasn't as big as I expected but definitely not a disappointment.  Would definitely recommend and it's incredible the amazing work these people do to support wildlife.  "

My 12 year old grandson adopted an orphan baby named peanuts. The work they do at the centre to rescue, rehabilitate and release these highly endangered animals is awe inspiring.

It is sponsored by a British charity, so there are many opportunities to help out and get some fun, unique souvenirs.You will start by putting your bags in a free locker, you can't carry anything with you besides a camera into the sanctuary. Then, you get to watch a short movie in an air conditioned room. This seems silly, but A/C is amazing when you can get it. Next, you get to so and explore the area. There are a few feeding times where the rangers put out food for the orang utans that have been released. We saw the one at 10am, and were lucky enough to see a previously released sanctuary orang utan names, Bellaluna, bring back her baby for feeding time. She then had to argue with the stupid macaque monkeys that wanted a free meal. It was absolutely amazing, they were so lovely and strong. My eyes leaked many happy tears. The feeding platform is maybe, 30 meters from the viewing platform, so picture opportunities are excellent.  You can also see the younger orang utans from an indoor facility and watch them play on the playground. (there's A/C here).If you are able with your timeline, you can go and see the sun bears then come back to see the 3:00 pm feeding, just keep your ticket. Before you leave, you have an opportunity to ""adopt"" an orang utan through Orang utan Appeal UK for the low price of 40 British Pounds, about $54. We adopted, Bidu-Bidu, because he's a naughty little primate, just like my own son. They do take credit cards or Malaysian Ringgit. We are anxiously awaiting our thank you gifts in the new year. If we ever get back to Borneo, this will be on my top 3 things to see again. We were so lucky with our sightings of Bellaluna and her baby. Must see, people, must see"

Two foreigners were taking picture of the orang utan, and when we were about to do the same, we were asked in a high voice, asking us to move away. (While the other two other foreigners were allowed to spend time with the orang utan).Double standard. Maybe they should move the whole center to Europe or other country."

4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 17 December 2017,Couples,We saw the orangutans in the wild in Danum Conservation Area and while in Sepilok we decided also to visit Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre. In the last years number of orangutans in Borneo dropped a lot due to high deforestation which made room for the palm oil plantations. Farmers killed a lot of orangutans and those which survived were brought here so their stories are quite sad. In the morning we saw a mother with her baby coming at the food platform but in the afternoon we have not seen any orangutan. There is an orphanage playground for the orangutans which lost their mothers and it is nice to see them playing around. If you did not see orangutans in the wild it's a good way of spotting them but if you have already seen them in the wild doesn't worth the effort.

Advise getting there a bit early so you can visit the orphanage, where you can watch at least 15 young orangutans playing and eating from behind glass. Great to be able to be basically guaranteed to see their interactions and movements. While walking to the feeding platform we were lucky enough to see a mother and her baby heading to the feeding platform as well in the trees above us. We saw 3 adults and 2 babies in total there and stayed watching them until closing time. Some groups were quite noisy - I'd really urge people to keep this to a minimum as we are in the their rainforest after all! Overall, really magical experience (though I know people in the mornings before and after were not so lucky so build in time into your itinerary so you can go more than once if necessary)."

I'd heard about Sepilok from other travellers who recommended visiting, so I took my final full day in Borneo to go.As I was staying in KK, I took an early 7am flight to Sandakan from KK, which took about 45 minutes and cost about 300 Ringit return (roughly ¬£50) but I imagine they could be cheaper booked in advance.  My return flight was 8pm that same evening.Once at Sandakan, I hailed an Uber which took me straight to the rehabilitation centre for a bargain 15 Ringit.  Once there, it's easy enough to get a ticket and have a wonder around.  Feeding times are at 10am and 3pm, so I went to both, visiting the Sun Bear sanctuary next door in-between.The experience of seeing Orang-utans so close and semi-wild was incredible, outdoing anything I've ever seen in a zoo environment.  There is a video that is played near the reception too, which highlights the work carried out at Sepilok, which makes the experience more valuable as you have an idea of how important the program is for the future of Orang-utans.I'd recommend visiting, no matter where you are in Borneo - it really was quite an incredible experience!The only issue I had was getting back to the airport - it was impossible to get an Uber back, so I took one of the clapped out public taxis with a miserable driver which cost 40 Ringit, 3x more than the comfortable air conditioned and friendly Uber I took there."
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 3 December 2017,Couples,My partner and I visited the centre with some reservations as we have seen places such as this marketed as being ‚Äúconservation‚Äù centres however were more like zoo‚Äôs and tourist traps. The Sepilok Orangutang rehabilitation centre‚Äôs primary focus is conservation and returning these beautiful creatures to the wild. The centre is set up to show the last two stages of rehabilitation and give you a possible sighting on the feeding platforms. The feeding platforms are used to supplement their diet in case they are struggling to find food. It doesn‚Äôt encourage them to not forge themselves. The only negative were the other visitors who were very noisy and disruptive. The centre promotes silence from all visitors to avoid disruption to the wildlife but this was not enforced. An improvement point for the centre would be to have a staff member stationed at the viewing platforms and reiterate this to tourists.

I had to drive from Kota Kinabalu to see what is half zoo in terms of the young orangutans and how you see them in a man made play area from air conditioned comfort ( from a visitor perspective i mean - they are clearly nowhere near a zoo in what they do)The ""wild"" feeding area is cool and it's probably the only way you are going to see orangutans in a land that is entirely decimated by greedy men.I was depressed driving from KK.  More than half the journey was through palm oil plantations and there were fires everywhere as they burned down even more beautiful forest. Lines of trucks spewing out fumes filled the roads. They were carrying hard wood !  There will be no forest soon and no home for these beautiful animals.Personally I think Sabah is the biggest disappointment in my five years on the road.  These adverts by the Malaysian government about Amazing Malaysia is just a scam.

Whilst we were fortunate to have seen orangutan in the wild in Lower Kinabatangan, it is still worthwhile and interesting to observe the semi-wild orangutan at the centre. There are no fences/netting so they can come and go as they please. If one were to see very few orangutan at feeding times, it is likely that the orangutan are able to find food on their own in the forest :) At the centre, one gets the chance to see (and photograph) the orangutan at a relatively closer distance as compared to its natural habitat where they are usually sitting high up in the canopy.Since our last visit in 2013, the centre has added a new section, the Outdoor Nursery, in 2014 where the younger orangutan first learn to be outside and play at the 'jungle gym'. Here, we watched the amusing juvenile orangutan in action from behind one-sided glass windows in an air-conditioned building. This means that we could see the orangutan, but they can't see us. That afternoon, there were three orangutan at the single feeding platform. We were also lucky to see a female orangutan and her baby swing by prior to feeding time.Tip: The feeding viewing platform can get really crowded and noisy (despite the 'Silence' or 'Senyap' signboard) during feeding times.

We saw them first in the nursery where the youngsters were being rehabilitated, then went along walkways to feeding stations which are stocked twice per day, with the food lasting about 20 mins before it was cleared.These feeding stations area sort of half way house for the animals as they are reintroduced to the wild.They go out and live in the jungle and return only if they need to, which was borne out by some Australians in our hotel who went to both morning and afternoon sessions on one day and saw nothing as the durian fruit were in abundance meaning no need to come to a feeding station.We, however, were extremely lucky to not only see animals which had returned to the wild, but also one returned mum who had bred in the wild and also a completely wild male who came looking for a mate.We also saw Sun bears who were part of the programme and some wild monkeys.We got some great photos to show to everyone back home.This is well worth a visit."

The feeding station and nursery are an amazing opportunity to see the Orangutans but can be very busy, especially in the mornings as that's when it's mostly tours.  The nursery viewing area is indoors, air conditioned and has seating.  If the purpose of your trip is to see Orangutans like us, then I recommend you stay at Sepilok Nature Resort (a few minutes walk from the Sanctuary), don't book a tour or a guide but go yourselves to the Santuary first thing in the morning, enjoy walking around at your own pace, take in the amazing scenery, see the Orangutans at the feeding station and nursery and return to the Resort for lunch as the Sanctuary closes.  Return as soon as it opens in the afternoon (using the same tickets).  On the walk there you can buy cold drinks from a small store on the road side.  You have a totally different experience from the morning.  Hardly anybody there to start with and we saw more Orangutans plus mothers with their babies which was incredible.

We did however adopt one of the animals because alternatives are rare."

We had an orangutan walk right by the side of us and one swing through the trees above us but this is exceptional. You might be lucky! It's really well organised and the staff are really helpful. Definitely worth going to see the sun bears. We were lucky enough to meet Mr Wong the founder who was so excited and enthusiastic - what a great guy.

Firstly the feeding of the young orangutans - this takes place in an area where you observe from behind a glass screen.  There are significant reflections in the glass to make good photographs near-impossible.  Although the viewing area is nicely appointed, it was spoiled when we were there by a bunch of English schoolkids that came in front of where we were sitting (the front row of the obseravtion tiers and spoiled the view.  Nevertheless it was good to see young orangutans although there are no very young ones as they are fed separately.  Secondly, there is a viewing are to see (young) adult orangutans come to feed.  They purposely provide boring feed to discourage them returning ponce they can forage in the wild.  This strategy has been very successful - we stayed for best part of an hour and no orangutans although there were some macaques gathering who hoped to steal the orangutan food."

We and together with many other noisy visitors were disappointed when our wait was not ""rewarded"" by the orang utan visiting us. LOL. Only when we read the informative notice boards that we learned that it is deliberate on the centre's behalf to only keep feeding the orang utan a single type of fruit. The OU like human gets fed-up with the food and therefore works harder in the forest to look for their own fruits. We believe it is also a fruiting season when we visited and there is a lot of food to be found in the forest. The visit to the nursery is very rewarding, because seeing the young OU playing and doing their monkey business is entertaining and gives me some optimism that at least they have a fighting chance to survive in the wild and hopefully keep the OU around for some more years to come before they become extinct. We met a young student doing research at the centre and it was pleasing to have a chat with this young Jane Goodall."

You'll see them mostly on the feeding platforms at the twice daily feedings.  My recommendation is to spend at least 2 nights in Sepilok.  If you stay at the Sepilok Nature Resort (highly recommended), whose property is contiguous to the orangutan center, you're likely to see free roaming orangutans in the trees over your bungalow in the early morning.  (Frankly, my best photos of the orangutans in naturalistic settings came at the resort.)  Then spend the day at the orangutan rehabilitation center and catch both the morning and afternoon feeding sessions.  Spend a second night at the Sepilok Nature Resort with another opportunity to see orangutans at the hotel in the morning and then spend the rest of the day at the Labuk Proboscis Monkey Sanctuary, which is less than hour's drive away.The only reason I don't give the Rehabilitation Center 5 stars is that most of the photo opportunities involve the apes on the feeding platforms rather than in a purely natural setting."

At Sepilok, you can even ""adopt"" a juvenile orangutan (the money is actually used to feed & rehabilitate all orangutan in their care) & receive email updates of their rehabilitation with photos and a DVD about your juvenile that tells the story of their rescue. This is a better, more meaningful way tourists to leave a positive impact long after their visit."

This is actually a very serious conservation project open to the public for 2 hours each morning and afternoon. The whole place is on a boardwalk for easy access. The nursery is a great oasis of cool with great views of youngsters playing on ropes and hammocks. You are behind glass to make the sitcom work but it makes photography harder. There are 2 feeding times in the middle of the morning and afternoon opening times but the orangutans were outnumbered by smaller interlopers.

We were lucky to see so many both away from and at the feeding platform.The sun bear sanctuary is right next door and is a must. So too is the trip to Labuk Bay which is about half an hour away. Here the monkeys attend feeding platforms at the edge of the mangrove forest and you can get some great images.We had a very informative guide who was happy to tell us lots about the feature as animals as well as other Bornean wildlife.All in all our visit to Sepilok was a highlight of our holiday and I would recommend to anyone visiting Sabah."

The excellent work done by the rehabilitation centre is obvious and, sadly, necessary, and whilst some reviews say that it feels like a zoo, I didn't¬†feel that at all. To me, we knew we were in the presence of wild animals, albeit needing a helping hand from us thanks to us causing the problems in the first place. I just have one suggestion - I think Sepilok should review the ""gift"" shop - whilst everyone¬†of our group went into the shop, only I bought anything, and I only bought 3 Sepilok keyrings. I am sure there is the potential to raise more money with some additional Sepilok souvenirs. Overall, we had a fantastic experience at Sepilok, and will continue to support their excellent work.

If we had been better equipped we would have carried more local currency but did not think of this - there are no money changing facilities closeby.Seeing the Orangutans was a lovely experience. We saw them come out to feed but this can be a bit of a waiting game. It's the perfect experience if you are a patient person as they do not often come out. I was left slightly disappointed by the fact that half of the centre was closed and therefore the path we followed to see the orangutans was halved and much shorter.We also saw lots of naughty macaques which was an experience in itself. Seeing them sneak up and steal the orangutans bananas was hilarious! You can't go all the way to Borneo and not visit so please do!

They have free lockers to leave all your stuff in as all you need is a camera and the monkeys have been known to steal bags. You make your way along a wooden boardwalk through the rainforest to the feeding platform - go a little early to secure a good spot. We saw orangutans at all 3 feedings we went to as well as curly tailed macaques. Saw a mother and baby twice which was great. The other great thing about this sanctuary is the outdoor nursery which there is an indoor viewing platform (airconditioned!) That you can sit and watch the younger orangutans play. We saw up to 6 or 7 at one time and got incredibly lucky and saw the large dominant male in the nursery who had apparently been around just this week for mating season.

Which is supposed to be a good thing, it means the orangutans are able to fend for themselves, they're learning to live independently without handouts.  But it could also mean that the human spectators were not quiet enough, or maybe too many humans were admitted that morning?There is an outdoor nursery, where orphan baby orangutans live, eat, play, and learn to climb, and make nests.  They are SO CUTE!  They have adoption programs if you're so inclined. We saw two adult orangutans in the wild, on the way from this nursery!

Do the night walk too with a guide - your lodge will organise it and it costs 120 ringgit. It is fascinating, but cover yourself in mosquito spray and take a torch. We saw orangutang, a slow loris and a couple of massive snakes ( a healthy distance away up a tree). And the rainforest noises at night are something else! "

4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 22 September 2017,Solo,This is a rehabilitation center/sanctuary for orphaned orangutan. Their natural habitat is also getting smaller due to the Palm Oil plantations. These animals are raised until they are ready to return to the wild. There is a nursery area that visitors can watch behind glass as well as an open area where you can see the caregivers feeding them. The facility has public bathroom as well as a small cafeteria you can buy lunches and snacks.

There's a nice cafe that serves local Chinese foods, 5 stars air conditioned public toilet, cheap park fee for locals, air conditioned (but not working during my visit) viewing auditorium & breath taking view of the huge tall forest species.

Our trip only involved a hours visit so didn't get much time to see anything because it was the river boat trip and lodge combined so time was limited. I have booked flights to return back to sepilok with out any guide so I can please my self as and when to what I do . Personally I think travelling your self is the best way and saved a lot of money after adding all the costs up. Sepilok is a fantastically run place and they do a great job . Hopefully my next visit will be a better one because it won't be rushed.

However, the morning schedule was not really worthwhile and as we were told, the orang utans prefer the second feeding time (and yes, there we had a beautiful view of two adults and a baby feeding). Arrive a bit earlier at the feeding station to get a good position.In-between feeding times, you can go to the Nursery Center, where you see baby orang utans via a glass window. It is such a wonderful experience to see the work done and these creatures living so happinly now. When the park closes for about 2 hours around noon, go to the Sunbear Conservation Center or get something to eat/drink at the cafe outside.Keep in mind that bags and bottles are not permitted inside the sanctuary, the first for the protection of the visitors and the second for the animals, I assume. Lockers are provided for free.The guards are very helpful and willing to answer your questions.You can wear bermudas/shorts and open shoes, there were not that many insects and the walk ways were fine.Only disappointment: the tourists who produced lots of noise while we were waiting for the orang utans to show up. Getting to Sepilok from Kota Kinabalu by bus takes 6-7 hours, from Sandakan it's about 20-30 minutes.Overall: super worth it!"

The setting is nice, you walk along boardwalks with handrails which wind around the jungle. At feeding time (10am and 3pm) most people gather near to the feeding platform where there is a good amount of viewing space and a member of staff delivers a huge basket of fruit to the platform. Then you have to wait for the ropes to start shaking which heralds the arrival of a hungry Orang Utan. Unfortunately on our visit no-one was hungry enough to come to the platform although we were lucky enough when we arrived to find one lounging around on the platform hoovering up the leftovers from the morning feed! We walked on to the outdoor nursery area and were treated to a great display of numerous adults and babies playing but the highlight was that, en route, two adults swung through the trees and joined the path a few feet away from us and wandered off to the nursery area. It really was a great experience. I would recommend moving around quietly, not in a crowd, being patient and definitely go and sit in the nursery area for a while."

On the second day we saw eight or nine on the feeding platform, and were able to observe the 'pecking order' for a couple of hours.

Obviously as the older ones are in the wild it is not guaranteed to see them but chances are high.There is a cafe on sight where you can eat a reasonable breakfast (or lunch ) as you need to arrive before 10.00 as this is the first feeding time for the older orang utans. These are the ones that have been released back into the wild but some return at feeding times.  (Second one at 3.00 and one ticket covers whole day).  Sanctuary does close between these topimes but there are sun ears on opposite side of road to visit if returning for sfternoon session.  Younger orang utans are looked after in a nursery section where they are taught to live in the wild before being released at approx 7 years of age.  You view these through immensely large glass windows where you will watch them playing, climbing/ swinging and eating.  There us a gift shop also but I felt that it needed a few changes as it didn't really sell too much on the orang utans and therefore is missing out on raising profit that could be ploughed back into the centre.You are also able to adopt an orang utan which us a good way to help this greatly endangered species."

We saw a mother and her baby feed at a platform.  They are amazing creatures.  We also got to see a green tree viper (beautiful and venomous) near the washrooms.We do wish there was an age limit, or that children were not allowed.  No matter the many signs saying ""Quiet"", or how perfectly behaved your children might have been up until the very moment they arrive, no one wants to hear fussing or screaming, especially here.

One morning we had only one orangutans and three macac monkeys who scare the orangutans aways. One afternoon we had at least 8 orangutans which was amazing.  The orangutans come into the viewing area so you do get really close. There are rangers on hand so everyone is totally safe.  An amazing experience.

We got to sepilok early but hung around until the centre opened. Tickets are cheap (plus a small price for photography). The centre is well maintained and the staff are helpful. If you don't go with high expectations you will find this place a pleasure. We were lucky to see two orangutans during our walk and around four at feeing time.

It's very hot in the jungle though watching the feeding and you're not allowed to take water in (so the orangutans don't steal it)

The work this place does is incredible.  All the orangutans are rescued and have names.  You get to see them on the platforms at feeding time, but even better than this is when you come across them on the various walkways.  You get so close to them it is simply incredible.  My one criticism of this place is the propensity of some of the staff to try to move you along when an orangutan appears.  When asked to do this, most people simply ignored this - this is why we visited this place after all!  There are also macaque monkeys here too.  Well worth a visit and right next door to the Sun Bear centre too.  Highly recommended and if you are travelling to Borneo, you MUST visit this place."

Orangs are rescued from captivity or bad situation and rehabilitated for living in the wild. The park is hudge and orangs can go around and enjoy the forest. Orang puppies (usually abandoned from their mother) are trained to be independent in the nature. The park has no boundary and orangs and other apes as well are free. During the feeding times in fact we saw not just orangs but also other monkeys coming from the forest of Borneo.This is a perfect example of eco and sustainable tourism for the environment and animals respect, it definetly deserve a visit."

The good thing is that finally the government has decided to ptotect this lovely animal. The money you pay to get into the park will be used to further develop this rehabilitation center.  Be aware that it can get really crowded, so going to the early morning feeding moment would be best."
3.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 21 August 2017,Solo,"I remain on the fence about my thoughts on this place.  There is certainly genuine animal welfare work going on here with Orang-utans orphaned from deforestation, and needing rescue from being illegally kept as pets.  Some have been successfully rehabilitated to the wild.They run a slick operation for the tourists, centered around two feeding sessions.  The morning fits with most of the pre-packaged tour schedules, and as such is a circus, as all the bus tours discharge.  Signs to be silent are ignored by staff and visitors alike.  Initially you can watch the young ones in the nursery from the comfort of an AC cooled, glassed room.  The feeding platform is open air.The afternoon feeding session is much quieter, and more pleasant and respectful for it.  Complaints on other reviews I‚Äôve seen that people didn‚Äôt necessarily see orang-utans at feeding sessions, I think miss the point.  The centre aims to encourage their rehab residents to move out into the jungle, by feeding them the same food each time, they tire and, hopefully branch out.  If you don‚Äôt see one (particularly in fruiting season, when the forest provides better for the orang-utans), it‚Äôs not the fault of the centre.  If your tour agency promised you viewings, and charged a hefty price for it as part of their package, take it up with them.  The entry cost is RM40 (~¬£13), including camera fee, and I really don‚Äôt see what people gained from having a guide, beyond them moving you on to meet the next step in your tour.  You can stay the whole day with that price, and so see both feedings.Rehabilitation centres such as these suffer 2 major criticisms, and should be viewed not just through your lense as a tourist, but the wider picture also.  Firstly, how does sponsoring and orang-utan, as you are invited to do, help protect current rainforest habitat, or even help recover areas to secondary rainforest?  Arguably, this is the conservation equivalent of closing the door after the horse has bolted.  Secondly, those involved in the palm or logging industry can point to these centres as acceptable alternatives to the natural habitat they destroy.  Neither of these issues are dealt with in the glossy intro video, which is in no way modest about this project being ‚Äòconservation that is not too late, but when it is needed‚Äô.You are very likely to see orang-utans here, an amazing experience.  If you don‚Äôt, well it does not entirely function as a wildlife-on-demand service.  If you want that, go to a zoo.  Really this place should aim to make itself redundant, but with so much tourist revenue invested in it, you wonder if it will ever try.There is an overpriced cafe on site with terrible service and worse food."

This Rehabilitation center is managed by the Government and it seems they do things seriously. It is possible to  enter in the center only with the camera, bags and anything else  must be left in special lockable padlocks. Inside the center, young orangutans can be seen from a window where they learn to hang on ropes, while in the outside area there is a platform where food is given at a preset time, but it is not said that Orangutans will come to eat. In fact, when I was here only one came to eat and because of  too many people he decided to seat giving us his back so he could eat in peace.  It is nice to see that the Government is doing something to save them...after it has giving the permits to destroyed their habitat.          The simplest way to get here is with a taxi, I found a really nice driver who was also a good company, his name is Arshad. he drove me here and next door there is another Sanctuary where the sun bears are.

The Centre does great work in terms of Orangutan protection and rehabilitation, and it's the ideal place to see these amazing creatures up close. However, there are just too many people here at the same time to really enjoy the experience, and of those millions of spectators too many are morons who cannot follow simple instructions, like keeping their voices down. Although we saw some orangutan here, I would say the experience as a whole was my least favourite of our entire trip through Sabah. I would rather take my chances on the Kinabatangan or in Danum Valley.For families with babies this is a tamer way to see the wildlife of Borneo, although we took our 1 year old on the river and into Danum Valley with no issues."

We headed to the nursery and on the way there was a female  orangutang walking on the rail of the walkway! Amazing! There was a ranger who was guiding her towards the forest again but a great sighting. The nursery was really enjoyable although they are behind glass they are in a large area with ropes and tyres. They were playing and very funny to watch. Once they had been fed all the naughty monkeys descended to grab what food was left which was a sight in itself. We didn't have time to visit the centre for the video but you shld do this too. It's a bit more expensive than near kuching and you have to pay for each camera!

The Orangutan's are free to go wherever they wish and that might be on the path you're walking on! I went in the morning and the afternoon so I got to see both feeding times (where they put food on a platform for the Orangutan's to eat) we saw one mother and her young baby there. Then as we were leaving the park a mother and her young baby came out of the trees right onto the path railings beside me. I was so close to these amazing creatures, in my Frozen state I did manage to get some pictures but I was literally less than a meter away and it was the most amazing feeling. In the afternoon we also had a young male walk alone the path with us but the park men did make sure you stayed back as they are still wild and can do damage if they wanted.. Not that you'd believe it with how calm and placid they are. Please do not expect to see what I did as every day is different but I really cannot stress enough the one in a life time experience I had here and I hope to remember that feeling for the rest of my life!! I hope you like my pictures!"

Get there early and stay until after most people have gone.  Don't miss the Nursery on the way to the feeding platform.  You are behind glass here but the young ones are great entertainment (also one afternoon not one orang-utan came to the feeding platform, so for people who missed the nursery they didn't see any orang-utans).  From the Nursery you can head to the feeding platform.  On 3 out of 4 visits orang-utans came to the platform.  They often also played around in the trees around the path as well.  On one visit we saw 3 or 4 in the trees above the path on our way out."

At 3pm is was raining hard and only one young one came out.Massively busy at 10am and way too noisy.Given the plane flight from KK and getting to Borneo in the first place we were just sadly a little underwhelmed that 'this was it'Great work for the folks there and a super cause, just a little light on a lasting experience to take away.We had more fun, less people and great pictures seeing the long nose monkeys half an hour away. Hey ho.It would serve the people and animals better if the government stopped cutting the jungle down and planting millions of palm trees for palm oil."

Visit at feeding times 10 and 2 but also be prepared for the mass or people who also want good photos.  hang around after the feeding is finished and provided the orang-utans  hang about you will get better photos.

Outside this area visitors walk through forest on raised walkways hoping to see some adult orangutans.  I was lucky enough to see two walking along the railings. Also saw some mothers and juveniles at feeding time. Take your binoculars as this happens some distance from the viewing platform.  Oh yes, you might also glimpse some orphan baby elephants in this sanctuary. "

On the day we were extremely lucky as 2 adult female Orangutans visited the feeding station with their babies. Fascinating to see this so close and in a natural habitat.Don't miss going to see the baby orangutans that are currently being rehabilitated. They are just like naughty children up to mischief and watching them play on the rope swings, tyres etc is heartwarming. Each one has it's own personality and it shines through.Great to see the hard work that the sanctuary are doing up close and how they are rescuing mistreated Orangutans and helping them to readjust to life in the wild."

We saw flying foxes, spiders, bats, snakes and loads of other creatures - including some sleeping orangutans who had made a nest by the walkway on our way out."

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 9 August 2017,Friends,A fantastic visit and a fantastic place. The tour begins with a video presentation about the centre and the work they do- this lasted about 40 minutes I think. It was interesting and shows the stages the orangutans go through when being rehabilitated. Next we entered the centre and visited the nursery area where you see the orangutans behind glass- lots of them playing around. The feeding platform is open and we saw a mother and baby come to the platform. Quite close and really cool to see. We also saw some of the orangutans whilst walking along the boardwalk. We got lots of excellent photos of the orangutans and really enjoyed our visit.

We were lucky to see an orangutan and her baby at the feeing platform as it was fruiting season and so sightings are not guaranteed. The outdoor nursery was great with lots if juveniles playing around."
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 9 August 2017,Couples,"Let me start by saying I was unwell during this visit, but still managed to have a good time. The toilets were English and spotless (you can see where my priorities were). I was separated from my group which was a blessing, walking slowly through the forest trail I was met by 2 enquisitive orangutans who just came out of nowhere and stayed a while to look at me and play with each other. Meeting my group, they had had similar experiences as they stayed away from the large group of chatty Chinese who seemed intent on making as much noise as possible. We left them to it at the empty feeding platform,  and went on to see more orangutans just walking by. Top tip: stay away from noisy groups, take your time and relax by sitting in the nursery observation room.Stop for lunch in the cafe - food is fresh and really good (I'm told - I was on lemonade).Sun bears are nice, but to be honest all I wanted to do by then was go back to our hotel.Don't book via agent...book your fights, get a taxi at the airport (there's a special desk where you pay so you don't get ripped off) and the pay at the reservation. ..you will save a fortune."
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 9 August 2017,Couples,"As many of us go to Borneo partly to see this amazing creature I would advise you do the rehabilitation centre on your own and avoid the tours. You can get a day ticket and spend all the time there to absorb the beauty of the surroundings. You can do the morning, go out for lunch and return at no extra cost. Yes go and see the Orang Utan at their feeding times, but await until crowds go and just wait to see what delights come within the quiet. We saw mother and baby and others at feeding time and lots of juniors in orphanage. Although we did go on a tour the following day (booked in our itinerary) we got less than an hour, which would have been devastating when we travelled so far. Would love to visit here again soon."

The staff are doing a tremendous job at rehabilitating Orang Utans so that they can return to the wild.  A cheeky and clever wild Orang Utan came visiting for an easy meal and the staff were vigilant in chasing it away to ensure it does not become dependent on the centre.  Be patient, be quiet and come back if you need to and you should not be disappointed in your visit to this sanctuary.  One of many highlights in our visit to Borneo."

The babies in the nursery were very entertaining, then we were lucky to see Ringo an adult orang utan come into the enclosure and help himself to the babies bananas. At feeding time only a mum and her baby appeared for a very short while. The monkeys took over the platform. We were unlucky not to see more on the feeding platform but the other sitings made up for it. A must do if you can, to cross it off the bucket list."
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 8 August 2017,Couples,"We had an extremely memorable visit at Sepilok Orangutan Santuary in July, one of the must see things to do when in Borneo. While this can feel like a very touristy experience, the work the santuary does in rehabilitating orangutan and educating the public is extremely important. Spend the extra time getting to the centre early to see the young orangutan in the outdoor nursery before the morning feeding at the outdoor platform. Get there early, at least 20-30 minutes before the feeding, as it gets very busy with bus groups running on a tight schedule. We saw a number orangutan in the area feeding before the groups arrived and as we weren't on a tour schedule, we could wait around until the tours left to see a couple of mothers and their young babies come down to the feeding platforms when it was quieter. You can see the short video presentation later if you are staying for the 3pm afternoon feeding, which runs again when the park reopens at 2pm. The fee charged to enter the sanctuary is fairly nominal, so if you feel like supporting the work the centre does, you can 'adopt' an orangutan for a modest annual fee. As the orangutan are mostly free fo come and go as they wish within the sanctuary, so there is no guarantee you will see any feeding on the day, although we were lucky to see 4 orangutan in the morning and 5 in the afternoon feeding sessions, as well as seeing orangutan along the trails in the sanctuary and across the road in the sun bear rehabilitation centre. A very memorable experience."

We didn't see any orang utan on our first visit to the feeding platforms at 1000, but went back in the afternoon at 1500 and there they all were!!!We also visited the 'kindergarten' where the youngsters entertained us - they were so cheeky and almost looked like they were performing for us, which of course they weren't - they were just being 'children'! The (optional) introduction 10 min film at the entrance is well worth watching as it tells the story of when and why the sanctuary exists. The Orang Utans appeared to happy and very well cared for with hectares of natural forest for them to enjoy whilst developing...You cannot really go to Sabah without visiting this 'attraction'. "

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 7 August 2017,Couples,This is an excellent programme aimed at rehabilitating Orangutans. Whilst the first impression given in the education centre may appear enclosed it is the visitor that is behind glass. The Orangutans are not enclosed and are free to wander off into the jungle. We got a different perspective when we returned for a night walk and walk around outside the glassed viewing area. It is true that the younger new rehabilitees tend to stay near the centre and we saw three hanging out there at night as they had not mastered making a tree nest at night. During the day we saw several out around the boardwalks completely free to wander. The feeding station does draw others in though only one female turned up to feed on our visit.
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 6 August 2017,Couples,"A visit whilst in Sabah is a must.  The Sanctuary is a fantastic opportunity to see organutans in their natural environment knowing they're also being cared for and rehabilitated.   We combined this with the Sun Bear Sanctuary but hands down this is far more interesting (Sun Bears don't seem to do a lot......).  The Nursery area can be viewed through a large screening window and you're around 10-20 foot away from the younger Orangutans who most definitely like to play up for the multitude of cameras pointing their way!  You can then wander through the rest of the sanctuary through a series of raised walkways and it's highly likely you'll come across older primates (some with their young) as you walk around.  We were close to spotting pygmy elephants as well but they're a bit elusive.  However, we did see a wagler green tree pit viper in one of the trees above us which was a bit nerve-racking...   The orangutans themselves are fairly timid but they appear to 'tolerate' humans being around them - they pretty much ignore you!  However, if you want to get up close and personal then this is most definitely a great place to visit."
3.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 6 August 2017,Couples,This was our first encounter with Orang utan in Borneo and I have to say it was disappointing. On the morning we went it was packed with tourists and thus noisy and to be honest I think the Orang Utan kept away. There were very few on the platform although the number increased once the number of rtourists reduced. I guess there is no upper limit on the number of visitors allowed at any one time. The Orang utan where on the platform and the platforms had lots of ropes for the orang utan to swing from so they didnt bother sitting in trees and using branches in a natural way (we never saw ropes in Indonesia Borneo at the feeding stations.I am a amateur serious photographer and other than a few close ups it was impossible to get a decent photo without man made objects in the shot.

You do have to pay to take your camera in, but the price is small when converted into british. Even if you have a quick look, the money for the entry fee does go to good use in rehabilitating orangutan's back into the wild. Our group adopted an orangutan from our left over budget. There is a sun bear centre across the road that also does vital work in trying to release these animals back into the wild."

For 30MR you have access to the sanctuary with a personal group guide. We spent about 1.5 hours walking around and saw several orang utans, vipers, frogs, flying squirrels etc. It is so great because you are in small groups and the guides are very knowledgeable and friendly. During the day we also had the opportunity to see the orang utans, but there were a lot more people and it was much noisier than the nicht tour. We say more orangutans at night and were able to get much closer. This place truly cares about the well being of the animals and lives up to their mission. Highly recommended!"

Some times the Orangutans won't show in 30 minutes or at all but the guides will still make you good,  I even heard a guide telling a family that there were Orangutans at the front gate ( that was a lie ) to get them out.If you go by yourself or at least ask the guide to stay all morning you will have much more chance of seeing them."

There are dozens of rangers around to prevent any direct contact, rightly so, as some visitors were a bit too keen in my view !Definitely something I'd recommend as opposed to a zoo, plus your admission pays towards conservation and protection of these endangered animals."

That's wild animals for you - they just don't follow the programme. So instead we walked down to the nursery where, eventually, a couple of small, (baby?) Orang Utan's had the decency to put in an appearance. There is much welcomed aircon in the nursery viewing galery. We actually got a real close Orang Utan experience at the Rainforest Discovery Centre a couple of days later.

Finally there are two feeds each day on the feeding platform, many more wild monkeys join them which is interesting! At one point one of the wild monkeys scared an Orang away who ended up falling, which prompted a ranger to walk over which in turn scared the other monkey away. So the O-U's are well looked after.

Unfortunately the nature trails were all closed 'until further notice' when we visited.  Staff told us this was because some dumb humans had fed orang utans they came across on the trail which obviously threatens their rehabilitation into the wild.  Dumb humans spoiling things for other people and the animals!The orang utans in the nursery are incredibly cute and one of them who is almost bald looks scarily like a human being.  The nursery building also has lots of information on these creatures who are being endangered by Malaysia's drive to produce palm oil.  Feeding time also brings orang utans swinging in on trees and ropes with macaques and even a squirrel also coming to see what food they can grab.

My advice would be to go to the morning and afternoon feedings if possible, or if you only go to one, go to the afternoon cos it is a bit quieter with less tourists. It was handy to go to both as we could go to the sunbear sanctuary next door In between. I read some reviews where they saw no orang Utans, we saw about 4/5 both times so I think we were really lucky! We also went to the nursery to see the younger orang utans being fed and there was another 5 there!

It can be a little crowded at the feeding platform but it's always worth waiting after most have left as often you can be rewarded with a repeat appearance in a less crowded and quieter environment.Although most are being prepared for independence and perhaps no longer require food to be provided, we still managed to see several pairs of mother and child Orangutan at the feeding platform and felt deeply privileged.Other monkeys compete for our attention like trapeze artists and one can hear trumpeting of Pygmy Elephants in the background.This is the only place to view wild Borneo Orangutans so the sanctuary could easily take advantage of this but not at all, one leaves feeling rewarded not exploited."

It has been developed so not as many monkeys come in to feed.1. There is a feeding platform for viewing of feeding about 75M in and  2. Further 75M in there is a nursery where a group of Orang Utan's place and can be viewed from air conditioned premises.Loved watching the black squirrels dart around the feeding platform.The boardwalk has been designed to allow Orang Utan's to come right up to you and local rangers will ensure you don't get too close. We had a couple of Orang Utan's less than 20M away from us.The location is also good, 50M walk to Borneo Bear entrance. Theres a good restaurant where you can eat lunch and have ice cream or drinks. Take note, there are lockers provided as you can only bring your camera and wallets in to avoid Monkeys snatching anything from you.There are hotels/resorts close by however this place is not going to be reached on foot. You need transport to be arranged or on a tour. The good thing is there aren't busload of tourists coming here."

I know this was a formal zoo setting but in all reality so was this.  We only got to see 3 adult Orangutan‚Äôs at Sepilok plus the ‚Äúnaughty‚Äù one on the walk to the nursery and here there were 2 adults and 2 babies.

This place is really incredible and one of my favorite places we visited during our travels around Borneo.Travelling from here to Kinabatangan, it is heartbreaking to see the sheer volume of destructed forest replaced by palm oil plantations.

Headed to outside nursery to watch a few young orangutan hang out and interact. Went to first feeding. Very crowded. Several orangutans came down to feed. Hung around for a while then disappeared back into jungle. Included a mum and bub. Went back to nursery only to have an orangutan ""rosa "" come down and walk along walkway with a group of us. She was headed back to the nursery. Amazing.Returned in afternoon for second feeding. Ticket allows re entry for day. Far less tourists. A couple of different orangutans came to feed. They hung around for a lot longer. Great interaction between 2 younger ones.Good information from guides.Need to leave bags in lockers but free and padlocked. Orangutans pinch bags otherwise!

Feeding times can get crowded and most of the crowd ignore the signs for 'Silence', although I think the Orangutans are used to it.

We then walked on the boardwalk through the jungle to the feeding platform and saw 5 adults feed, one with her baby. It was amazing and very emotional. After this, we watched a short documentary and then left for the Sun Bear centre over the road. After this, Lard kindly took us to a mangrove area to observe the very unusual Probiscus Monkeys.

We took the early morning flight (6.35am) from Kota Kinabalu to Sandakan, which took less than 45mins and cost about $35 each return with Air Asia. We took a taxi but decided to go to the Rainforest Discovery Centre first, as the Sanctuary doesn't open until 9am. We had a nice walk round and were told if you're lucky, you can spot some wild orangutans in the rainforest. We walked to the sanctuary, which was just over 1km. We didn't realise it was cash only, but fortunately had enough!! We went to the feeding platform around 9.40am, ready for the 10am feeding session. Luckily, we got a good spot right at the front and watched our first orangutan of the day!! There were also Proboscis monkeys too. We then walked to the nursery, but saw more orangutans in the trees (including a grumpy one!!). We decided to watch the DVD after the feeding session. We also adopted an orangutan (credit card payment). Our flight wasn't until 2.30pm, so we visited the Sun Bear Conservation Centre (next door to the sanctuary). They accept credit card payments. We saw a few bears sleeping in the trees, then spotted another orangutan on our way out!! We figured our two boys would have been too tired and bored on an actual day's tour, so glad we did the DIY option. Taxi each way was around MYR40."

We went back in the afternoon and there were less people and a lot of orangutans. The key is to be patient!  It's also worth. Outing that the sanctuary shuts between 12 and 2.

Go prepared to be alert and seize any opportunity to observe the orangutans and hopefully you'll be rewarded. I saw a couple at fairly close range on my way to the feeding platform. This was a much better experience than the 10:00 feeding itself, which was overcrowded. By the 3:00 feeding the crowd had thinned out. There were a couple of orangutans who showed up. But it was only as the place was preparing to close that things got really interesting. A couple of orangutans descended to the wooden walkways and got up close and personal. The rangers were banging their sticks to discourage them from getting too close, but we were told that one of the orangutans was very naughty. He has been known to grab people."

I've watched about Sepilok in National Geography & Discovery Channel, hoping we might be able to see them closer, but it was rather disappointing. But the orangutans are naturally shy, so we have to understand if they sometimes do not appear out of the jungle to the feeding platform or pose for photos. There were many local and foreign tourists waiting around to see them at the plaftorm.However, we can watch them in action playing, swinging around in their playground, from a comfortable viewing room. When we were there, the room was quite full, but still quite comfortable. It would be helpful if we can hear some explanation about their activities, what are they doing, etc over the speaker. So that we can learn more about them.Other than that, we also visited the Sun Bear Conservation Centre nearby.

The cost of entry in to the place is not very expensive and to experience watching these majestic creatures is priceless.  The morning feeding was quite busy but worth looking at the outside one.  My cousin and I did that, then went to the nearby Sun Bear sanctuary and on to the rainforest education centre before returning for the afternoon feeding.  In the afternoon there were a lot lot less people and you could watch the apes from the inside viewing room.

Reminder to get there as close to 9am as possible so you can go to the nursery before the 10am feeding. Don't rush off to the next thing after the young adult have finished feeding at the platform, once it quietens down with tourists the mums bring their babies to the platform. Take your time and exit by 12 when the sanctuary closed for ""Lunch"". Use this time to watch the video and visit the Sunbear centre before coming back at 2pm for 3pm feeding. We found that the 3pm feeding had far less tourists and was more enjoyable. Remember this is a sanctuary for wild animals it is not a zoo. You are not allowed to get too close to the orang utans, even if they come up to you. They like to steal guests' sun glasses, hats, cameras etc and will chew them.

Orangutans are very difficult to spot in the wild as they are solitary and tend to be deep in the jungle so make the most of this experience at the sanctuary as you may not get this close to them again!

You can return several times on the same day for the one price- at feeding times and at other times. This is recommended as every visit has something new to offer e.g. we were privileged  to see an orangutan making a nest in a tree nearby, on a return trip. This is not a zoo and that makes it all the more worthwhile waiting for a sighting of these amazing primates in their natural habitat. "

We were lucky enough to see around 6/7 Orangutans swinging around in the trees as we walked through to the outdoor nursery. The outdoor nursery itself was brilliant - we found we saw more activity in the afternoon with around 14 orangutans, including two little babies, exploring and playing in the area - they kept us entertained for the whole afternoon üòä !! I would definitely recommend signing up for the night walk they offer. It's not very well marketed but if you ask when purchasing your tickets they will put you in the list. I cannot believe how lucky we were - our guide was amazing - so knowledgeable and fantastic English. We were even joined by an orangutan at the start of walk as she made her way back to the rainforest - it's one of the most magical memories I have!! "

We saw a mother and baby, and another - this was the morning feeding. Make sure you get there first and get a great photo spot. Actually we came back to see the bears next door and two additional orangs were just sitting on signs outside."

From Sandakan it is about 30 minutes by road, and you could this bit by yourself by just grabbing a taxi. However, you could be very disappointed if you did. The sanctuary is engaged in returning orphaned Orang Utan to the wild, and so you can see some which are prepared for just that day, but as for the older, mature Orang Utan they are far a few between because they have been released and are back in the wild. There is a feeding table, where tourists assemble nearby at 11am and at 3pm to watch the Orang Utans feed, that is if they turn up! The Orang Utans are fed only bananas in the hope that they get bored and so will forage further away to search for different fruits. They have no interest in turning up twice a day to entertain the assembled tourists! Indeed, as it was the assembled 50 or so tourists left disappointed! We, though, had been very lucky on the way in through the forest to find an excited Ranger pointing skyward where there was a 'wild' Orang Utan going slowly through the trees which we fortunately photographed there and then; it was only later that we realised why the Ranger had been so excited to see an Orang Utan at all! And so we were really happy that there was more to the tour than just this sanctuary."
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 2 June 2017,Couples,"Very meaningful to see the orangutans are protected and fed. The center is peaceful. We planned a full day to visit this place but turned out it was worth half a day only. They feed 2 times per day, 9:30-10am and 2:30-3:00pm and outside this time, there is not much to do. We arrived at 11am, thought that we could do some trails but all the trails are closed without mentioning it online in advance, so we had to wait till 2pm to get the tickets. If you arrive from Kota Kinabalu, try to catch the bus early so that you could be here at 2pm. If you arrive from Sandakan, take the bus from Sandakan town which costs 6rm pp one way. One thing I find it inappropriate is that they charge 30rm for Non-Malay which is 6 times more for Malay, and 10rm for camera take-in."

I returned to the sanctuary on five occasions as I enjoyed this day more than any other in my 3 months travelling Asia. One small gripe, I would like to see the staff enforce the silence rule as it is unfair to the Orangutans when people make a lot of noise.

You can see they really are trying to conserve the species and that they genuinely care for them. We were lucky to have Fernando from Borneo eco tours who was a font of knowledge and made our trip very special. He had some fantastic photos of his favourite orangutans  and some hilarious stories to share. We both felt very lucky to have him as our guide and he made sure we saw the sunbears and even saw mr Wing who started the Sun Bear Sanctuary. My only criticism is that It's not clear that if you want a polo shirt or t-shirt with orangutang eyes on ( all very cool) you need to buy from the stand outside the shop that also allows you to adopt an orangutang. I was so disappointed as I wanted to do both, but when I asked it was the persons day off and no one could help me. Thankfully I can adopt in U.

On that visit we only had access to the walkways and the viewing platform to the outside feeding area where we were enthralled by the antics of the young Orangutans that were unfortunate to have to be there. I say unfortunate, because of the cutting down of their habitat to plant Palm Oil! On this most recent visit in April 2017 we were also able to view the nursery area of the sanctuary. We were the ones caged in, behind glass windows. But still we were entertained again by these beautiful creatures. The mum and her baby eating a banana being tormented by a young Orangutan who wanted to 'share' the treat. He eventually got some!  The Orangutans have free range over the sanctuary and we were able to see one up close and personal as we came out of the nursery area as a large male wandered over the pathway and fences back into the safety of the nursery area. There is a small shop and cafe area but don't expect lots of stuff to,spend your money on. You are not allowed to take bags or bottled water round with you.

The trails were closed for whatever reason, as no information was given as to why - I'd certainly liked to have walked the trails away from the crowds. We went back a week later on an afternoon and it was much quieter and were rewarded with considerably more orang-utans both in the nursery and the feeding platform and an incredible moment when one came crashing thru the trees and landed right next to us and wandered up and down the handrail.... great moment."

Just before feeding time we passed by 3 Orangutans less then a metre away, making their way towards the nursery. The staff are amazing at what they do and make sure the apes are not interfered with by the visitors and a free to roam around the grounds as freely as the would in the wild!! Definitely a must do in Borneo"

It is worth it to see the orangutans but dont stay in sepilok more than a day, because there is nothing else to do except see the orangutans and sun bears, and that only takes two hours tops. There were soooo many people watching the orangutans in the morning feeding, so maybe go to the afternoon feeding. And get there early to stand at the front. "

I loved the night tour that we did. It was absolutely worth it! We had 2 guides ; 1 from the tour that we paid for and another 1 provided by the center which is mandatory. The animals we saw- young white viper, flying squirrels, different insects, fruit bat and more! I found the guide provided by the center to be very knowledgeable and respectful of the animals which is great since you don't want to startle them otherwise they'd be running away. Once again, a great experience for us!"

Each time in the day we saw many orangutans; in the outdoor nursery, in the jungle close to the boardwalk or on the hand rail, and at the feeding platform. The feeding is at 10am and 3pm each day. Get there early if you want a front row spot! (About 9.45) You can't take bags in but can have a camera or phone. The outdoor nursery is open in the morning and again in the afternoon. We saw much more in the afternoon - 12 orangutans there at one time. The night walk is also a must. 30myr each. You meet your guide at the entrance at 6pm just before sunset. You get to see flying squirrels as they start to come out to hunt. Also lots of other things like snake, frog, orangutans, birds, stick insects and scorpions. We were lucky to see a slow loris too. The guides are great at spotting things!"

We loved watching the young Orangutans playing in the nursery section. There are lots of ropes, swings and obstacles that are designed to help build up the young Orangutans climbing strength. We learnt so much from the guides, video presentation and photographs in the display area.A great place to guarantee sightings of the Orangutans and we were able to see them at the morning feeding time.But please be careful on the wooden walkways, the boards can get very slippery after a downpour."

Feeding times are a highlight, but get there early as (a) it gets busy so you get a front row spot and (b) the orangutans also arrive early and you get to see them in relative peace before the feeding (and the crowds)"

The feedings attract some of the mother's with their young, which is great to see. The nursery also offers a very close view of some of the younger orangutans playing and feeding - make sure your visit includes a stop here.Sadly, the walking trails were not open during my time here. Not sure how easy it is to spot the apes on these trails, but I came across a few who were walking the public walkways in the small part that was open to us anyway ! The video shown opposite reception (20 mins) is well worth a watch to get a bit of background on the centreThe cafe (located in front of the site) serves a decent selection of food and drinks"
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 21 April 2017,Couples,"We came here 12 years ago and were very glad to come back.  It hasn't changed much and the excellent work that the staff and volunteers do continues to help save the wonderful orangutan.  We went to both the feeding sessions at 10am and at 3pm.  The 3pm session has fewer visitors so is a better time to go.  The biggest change from the last time we visited was the creation of the viewing gallery in the nursery to watch the youngest of the orphans who are very entertaining to watch.  You can take photos here but the reflection from the glass front is a problem.We were extremely lucky to be treated to what can only be described as a star performance from orangutan Rosa who decided to come and say hello to a group of us gathered by the bag lockers.  She posed for photos, showing off and often smiling straight into the cameras and pretended to sunbathe on the roof.  We were only 3 metres from her and she loved the attention.  This lasted about 15 minutes until she decided that was enough and disappeared back into the trees.  It was well worth the expense of the trip just for that alone!If you're based in Kota Kinabalu and plan to go with a travel agent based in your hotel make sure you book well in advance, at least a few days.  The price of the excursion does not include the air fare which can go up from booking to booking.  So be warned that you could be paying twice as much air fare as the person who just booked it in front of you.  If you book in advance you stand a better chance of avoiding this annoying fluctuation.The sun bear sanctuary is also on site and well worth a visit.  Not so good as the orangutan, but the people there are doing a magnificent job too."

You can see orangutans feeding as well as younger ones playing in the nursery. That was my highlight.Only downside: compared say to seeing orangutans in Sarawak this felt a little crowded including visitors with cameras the size of rocket launchers. And, perhaps staff could tell people‚Äã to be quiet more. That said, overall a great place to go."
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 20 April 2017,,I was worried it might be more about keeping some orangutans to get the tourist dollar than a rehab centre but was really pleased to find out my concerns were unfounded. It definitely appears to be a genuine rehab centre and the fact that you may be unlucky and not see an orangutan even at feeding time is part of the proof and a good thing as it means that generally the orangutans are feeding themselves as they should be! I have seen that some visitors don't get to see even one orangutan as none come to feed that day but we were very lucky!  We went twice - morning and afternoon. The afternoon was much better - few people and we really got lucky - three times an orangutan came out of the forest and crossed the boardwalk right beside us - only one time was anyone else around and the rangers arrived quickly to keep you from getting too close to the orangutan. The other two times we got to watch the orangutan climbing and eating in a tree beside the boardwalk - really close up which was fantastic!! A few others came upon us and got to watch too but no crowds so it was good. The morning seemed very crowded in comparison. Other things - The butterflies we saw were also stunning - and a troupe of long tailed macaques an added bonus (even if they are seen a lot!!) The reason for the 4 star not 5 is simply because after going to the sunbear centre next door we were so impressed with the staff there and their chatting to you and information they give you in your chats and their obvious passion - which we didn't see here. To be fair though there are probably a lot more people going to the orangutans than the bears and staff probably get sick of tourists but the difference was noticeable!! However as said - a lovely place which appears to be a very genuine rescue and rehab centre and the boardwalk through the forest is really nice in itself!! 
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 20 April 2017,Couples,Magical visit to see these amazing  animals close up. Young ones in trees as we approached then we saw 2 mothers with babies on feeding platform. Their expressive faces and almost human behavior was fascinating. At 30 ringgit each - less than ¬£6 it was well worth the money especially as it goes to the running of the centre. They also help orphaned babies and release then back into wild. There are many overpriced trips advertised but if you can organise your own travel you save lots. We also did the evening walk seeing even more orangutans so close they were  almost touching us. With a personal guide to find exciting wildlife in the dark such as flying squirrels and slow loris. Again only 30 ringgit each.
2.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 20 April 2017,Friends,"Very sad to rate this so bad however this venue isn't all it's made out to be in my opinion.I've had on my bucket list since being a child to come to Borneo and experience time sitting in the jungle with these beautiful animals. Planned and organized this trip for months and was so disappointing. The reserve is massive but you can only venture in a few hundred meter at the most, lots of trails closed and only the walkways close to the nursery area available to visit. In my opinion there are too many people allowed at once, it was noisy with kids screaming and no one telling them to be quiet. Adults also were laughing and joking around. Saw only one small Orangutan and then it was quickly moved away as too many people around (even though she decided to come down from the trees herself) Visiting hours are sectioned so be sure to get here early before the crowds or later when everyone has gone.Travelled half way across the world to experience the tranquillity and serenity of being on the jungle and was hugely disappointed and won't ever get the chance again to see in the wild/semi wild.Personally I found the sunbear reserve a lot more engaging and educational and would recommend to anyone wanting to understand more about this animal and the threats to its existence by man!"

We were always going to visit it was just a question of organising things.There are plenty of expensive tours from KK - but I'd advise against them. Just book the plan tickets (not included in the tours anyway) and we hired a car from Hertx for ¬£30 or so for the day.Entrance to thee park is 30 Ringit (10 I think for teens?) + something to take in cameras with proper lenses.It's next door to the sun bear rehabilitation centre too (less impressive), they share the same car park.Get there for the 10 am feeding - but plan to go back for the 3pm too - there's far fewer people (no tour groups) and as it's quieter, you have a better chance of more orang-utangs coming to the platform.Sadly when we visited the trails were closed (supposedly because some idiot tourists had been feeding the orang-utangs). Bring insect repellant (but not into the reserve), maybe a poncho/umbrella. You can't take bags (even camera bags) in - so either pick one lens and stick to it, or pack stuff in pockets. We did lunch at the resort just up the road, overlooking the lagoon."

Only 1 orangutan turned up at morning feeding but loads of other monkeys.

Most people do morning only, so there were less people here at afternoon but 8 organutans came  including some mums n bubs.  Wow.

Then you can walk round to the nursery where the little ones live in captivity (for their own protection), but with lots of space. The second part is along wooden platforms in the jungle, where the Orang Utans live close, but in the wild. They have the possibility to venture as far out into the jungle as they like, and some never return. There is food for the resent releases, and they come and eat while you wait quietly. No real interaction cause they are in their habitat."
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 14 April 2017,Friends,"The Sepilok Orang-utan rehabilitation centre is an inspiring place.  It is wonderful to see the care and attention that goes into trying to ensure the future of these wonderful orang-utans.  As the centre is doing as much as possible to help the orang-utans live their wild lives, you are not guaranteed to see lots of orang-utans as they may not chose to come in to feed at the time you are there.  This happened to us, which was disappointing, and our advice would be not to commit to a single visit only as people who went both to both morning and afternoon feeds reported an increase in orang-utans in the afternoon.  We did see lots of babies (through glass to protect them from us!) and they were hugely entertaining.  There is other wildlife in the grounds although we only heard the pygmy elephants!  Even without seeing as many of the animals as we'd hoped to, by going to the sanctuary we know that we have made some contribution to their future.  Please be sure to go when you're lucky enough to be in Borneo."

It gets quite busy, particularly at the first feeding, so go for both or just the afternoon as it's much quieter.

(There were a lot of school children there but they were in a separate building)   We arrived with our guide about an hour before feeding time so we had time to have a wander around and look at the nursery which was lovely - seeing the young ones play - it is through glass but there is a big area with lots of seats.  We then got to the viewing platform about 20 minutes before feeding and were right at the front.  Two mothers came down with their babies which was truly lovely to see, along with lots of squires and  the ever present macaques.  We were also lucky enough to have two orang-utans follow us along the boardwalk - the rangers were quick to move us along but it was a great experience and you felt very safe.  Great experience."
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 12 April 2017,Couples,"What a great experience ‚Äì Not to be missedSepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre in the Malaysian Sabah District of North Borneo was founded in 1964, to rehabilitate orphan orangutans. The site is 43 sq km of protected land at the edge of Kabili Sepilok Forest Reserve. Today around 60 to 80 orangutans are living free in the reserve.Consequently, 43 sq km of protected land at the edge of Kabili Sepilok Forest Reserve was turned into a rehabilitation site for orangutans, and a centre built to care for the apes. We think around 25 young orphaned orangutans are housed in the nurseries, in addition to those free in the reserve.Some of the other animals which have been treated at the centre include; sun bears, gibbons,Recently rehabilitated individuals have their diet supplemented by daily feedings of milk and bananas. The additional food supplied by the centre is purposefully designed to be monotonous and boring so as to encourage the apes to start to forage for themselves.Sepilok is considered by the Wildlife Department to be a useful educational tool with which to educate both the locals and visitors alike, but they are adamant that the education must not interfere with the rehabilitation process. Visitors are restricted to walkways and are not allowed to approach or handle the apes.At Sepilok a buddy system is used to replace a mother‚Äôs teaching. A younger ape will be paired up with an older one to help them to develop the skills they need.The creation of reserve areas minimises the impact of deforestation on orangutans and far fewer young apes become the victim of the illegal pet trade as a result of these ‚Äòsanctuaries‚Äô. Babies are often caught during logging or forest clearance or captured by poachers who slaughter the adult apes to reach them. The Malaysian Government has clamped down on illegal trading; outlawing all such practice and imposing prison sentences on anyone caught keeping them as pets.Youngsters kept in captivity often become sick or suffer neglect which in some cases extends to cruelty. Whilst some of the orangutans raised as pets can never be returned to the wild, others can be rehabilitated; it is a long and expensive process, taking up to seven years but one centres such as Sepilok take on without question.Where is Sepilok?Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre is situated in the State of Sabah in Northern Borneo and sits on the edge of the Kabili forest reserve. We flew from KK to Sandakan ‚Äì its takes about 1 hr and then a bus will take you to the centreHow to get to the Centre?From: There are five public buses which come directly to Sepilok (at  9:00am, 10:30am 11:30am, 1:00pm and 2:00pm) and five returning back to Sandakan (at 10:30am, 11:30am, 12:30pm, 2:00pm and 4:00pm). The bus journey takes 45 minutes and costs 4RM per person.  Many of the hotels nearby can also arrange a shuttle service and it is very easy to take a taxi too.From Kota Kinabalu: The journey takes 5 hours by bus stopping at junction ‚ÄòJalan Sepilok‚Äô, a 2.5 km walk from the centre.  However, there are frequent flights from KK to Sandakan which take approx. 45 minutes with return prices starting from as little ¬£20 GBP.  We booked in our hotel but some booked direct Kioni wanted to charge us ¬£450 each ‚Äì Book locally and save your cash, the centre is open daily 08:45am-4pm It cost 30RM for foreign tourists, the ticket allows you to attend both feedings that day.to the public but you will need to check the flights There is also a camera fee of RM10 (approximately ¬£2) should you wish to take your camera to the feedings with youThe feeding times are at 10am and 3pmThe Centre cares for young orangutans orphaned as a result of illegal logging and deforestation and those who have been illegally caught and kept as pets. Baby orangutans are cared for 24 hours a day, just like a human baby and as they grow older they join their peers in the nursery and at night they are housed indoors for their safety.You are not guaranteed to see an orangutan These orangutans are living wild in the reserve and come back for a free feed should they wish - for this reason sightings cannot be guaranteed.The numbers of orangutans which come to the feedings differs on a daily basis and as they are wild and free to travel in the reserve. We were lucky seeing over 20 in the morning and 25 in the afternoonIs there anyone who can answer my questions that I have at the centre?There were Liaison Officer based at the Centre, who provide details, and were happy to answer any questions and point out various characters from the feeding platform.What can I expect from my experience at Sepilok?The visitors, having seen the educational (although optional) DVD at the centre, make their way through the forest to the viewing platform. From here they can witness the successfully rehabilitated orangutans living wild in the reserve coming for a free feed. It's a magical experience, as the trees begin to shake, and a flash of orange appears. Two rangers will arrive with fruit and sugar cane to place on the feeding platform, approximately 60 feet from the viewing platform. The orangutans that come for this free feed are wild and therefore can be dangerous, so there are staff on hand to make sure interactions do not occur, for the safety of both visitor and orangutan. Because they are wild, it can never be guaranteed that many will come for the feed, if any at all (especially during the fruiting season). This is where some people leave disappointed, but the truth is if no orangutans come, then it is a positive thing - it means they are not reliant upon the feeding to survive.  You will however have a magical experience in the forest surrounded by the sights, smells and sounds of Borneo.There are also various nature trails and walks within the reserve; from tropical highland rainforest, to lowland mangrove swamps where wildlife can be seen including orangutans and nocturnal animals on the night walk. The walks vary from 250 m to 5 km.There is a cafeteria on site where you can buy breakfast, lunch, snacks and drinksYou can also adopt or give a donation when you are at the Centre.  Please speak to our Liaison Officer who will be happy to help you. If she is not available please complete an adoption leaflet from the desk in reception area and place it in the slot on the desk along with your donation.There are lockers available for the use of visitors; there are two sizes and the larger one will hold a large backpackOverall ‚Äì what a great day out, although we had to get up at 4.30 am and arrived back at 7.30 pm it was definitely worth it.   Don‚Äôt book before you travel from the UK, use the local agents.  We were luck and saw over 45 orangutans, sun bears and other monkey during the day.  Having seen these apes and seeing what is happening to their habitat it‚Äôs a tragedy such a great ape can be pushed out of its environment for palm oil trees.  When will we all wake up and see what counts"

Wonderful to see this rehab work sustained over many years and has not lost its authenticity. 
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 8 April 2017,Friends,"You get a pretty good view of the orangutans at the feeding sessions.  We took in both the morning and the afternoon feedings.  It is a bit far away for a regular camera (you would need a telephoto lens to get a really good picture, and binoculars to observe the animals in detail).  The initial video is worth seeing.  And the outdoor nursery is a must."

4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 8 April 2017,Family,"We stayed in Kota Kinabalu and did a day trip/flight to Sandakan.  We went to visit for the first feeding of the day, however no Orangutans turned up.  From a tourist point of view a little disappointing, however from a rehabilitation point of view, brilliant! We did see one orangutan moving from tree to tree, which was a great site.  We visited the nursery and got to see some baby Orangutans.  They were very playful and was a great site to see.  Kid loved it.  Even though we did not see the Orangutans at the feeding station, it's still worth the visit.  Unfortunately our flight schedule did not allow us to see the second feeding, otherwise we would have definitely gone back."
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 8 April 2017,,"Well maintained boardwalk to get to the orangutans, the nursery viewing is behind glass so the youngsters don't catch anything from the human visitors and also doesn't frighten them, purely for selfish reasons just made observing them slightly less fun and spoils the quality of the photos. The play area for them is great and the grounds are very well maintained. The adults could also be viewed in the forest was amazing to be see them close to when they climed across the roof of the viewing platform and down the supporting beams. Great work being done"

Walk to free range adult area but they were disinclined to appear they day I was there.  However, walking through the park was pleasant.  An good cafe and a small souvenir shop with limited items.  Next door is the Sun Bear sanctuary so both can be done in half day."

Walking along the boardwalk two orangutans came out of the trees and walked up the boardwalk in front of us. Fun watching the babies at play in the nursery. Unfortunately no orangutans came to the feeding platform on the day we were there. Kiosk, gift store and toilets on site."

The facility is well set up and revolves around the feeding times. We were there in the morning and it was very crowded (and very hot and extremely humid). For those who are old or mildly disabled bear in mind there is a lot of walking to do.It was fun to see the antics of the orang-utans whilst feeding, but more important that a sanctuary like this exits for orphans and wild orang-utans.Please help support them."

That's when all of the tour groups arrive and due to the noise the monkeys won't come out.Go in the afternoon at 2 PM. When everyone goes to the outdoor nursery, go the other way. Walk towards the feeding platform. There were no one else around I bumped in to these beauties."

It was wonderful to see these magnificent creatures being so well protected and treated with such respect. We were fortunate to be able to visit twice while we were staying in Sepolik and I highly recommend the experience.
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 3 April 2017,Family,"Worth going to have a look if your in the area, this attraction is as I expected and in some ways a lot better. The whole facility is well kept with plenty of knowledgeable staff on hand to help out, this appears to be well funded, the place is clean, tidy and allows you to just sit and watch these primates. As soon as we arrived and started to walk up the board walk, one appeared on the hand rail literally 2to3 feet away, at all times when they are close a warden is close by, we just stood there and let it walk by. Fantastic experience, a wonderful place for children. The forest area is just nice to stand and absorb."
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 2 April 2017,Solo,"I came to a morning feeding and was awe struck by the orangutans. We got lucky and saw 6-7 different orangutans feeding, two of which had their babies in tow. The feeding lasted about 30 minutes and then some of the orangutans stayed near the viewing deck, which was the funniest part because one got really close to all of the viewers. They don't let you bring bags inside, but there are free lockers that you can store all of your belongings. I didn't go to the nursery part of the park but I would recommend seeing that as a friend of mine had an awesome time watching the baby orangutans play with their handlers.  Even though I got lucky with the morning feeding and saw quite a few orangutans, another friend of mine only saw one when she went, so if you can make it a full day and go to the morning and afternoon feedings you will be sure to see lots of orangutans!"
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 2 April 2017,Couples,Amazing rehabilitation center because orang Utan are free to roam and have lots of spaces. About 200 of them and you can see the toddler learning how to climb and having fun. One is stray off to the roof top and the volunteers trying to pull it back! Feeding area is based on your luck! 10 am and 3 pm. The semi wild orang utan will come back to the feeding platform. But sometimes not! Especially the male ones can stay into the forest and find their own food. Like the idea orang utan come and go to the jungle as they please;) good job!

Looking at the Orang Utan - been cared and rehabilitated is such joy. As many had said, best to be here during feeding times so we can get a closer look at them. There are also many macaque monkeys around. Well done to the staff of the Sanctuary."

They are fed twice daily so it would be a good idea to visit during feeding time as then they often disappear.

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 29 March 2017,,We were lucky enough to witness the orangutan coming down to have some breakfast.  The anticipation as you stand and wait is something else. Then when you start to see the trees move you know you have been lucky this morning and at least one of these great apes has come to see you. We were lucky enough to see a mother and baby from last year first and then another mother and older baby soon joined. It's a little trek into the jungle and if you have elderly people with you it may be worth waiting at the beginning as there is a feeding station there as well. Definitely worth a visit. 
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 29 March 2017,Couples,Fascinating place. We learned much about the fate of the Orang utans. Visitors need to take note of the Silence notices around the park. There were too many people talking all the time and the Orang Utans were nervous 
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 28 March 2017,Solo,"Great experience. You need to leave your personal possessions behind in case the orang utans take them! You can watch them coming to feed and also at the nursery. Too many people there to easily take pictures. Didn't see very many. It's great they have this and look after the orphaned ones. This is not a zoo, they are all free to roam around."

We were fortunate to see a mum and her energetic baby at both feeding times, along with a number of other orangutans who stopped by the feeding platform for some food. We walked the boardwalk loop several times across the day and were very fortunate to spot several orangutans swinging through the trees just going about their business. It is a wonderful sanctuary and inbetween the feeding times we popped over to the nearby sun bear facility which is also well worth a visit."

3.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 24 March 2017,Couples,We visited Sepilok as part of an organised tour. We arrived first thing in the morning and our guide took us straight to the nursery where we watched the young orangutans for quite a while before the crowds arrived. The downside was that feeding time was extremely crowded and incredibly hot standing in close proximity to hundreds of other tourists. There were only a couple of orangutans that day but it was still nice to see.
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 24 March 2017,Couples,"This sancuary has a good record of saving orang utans from illegal poachers and pet shops. The programme of bringing up orphaned ones is amazing in that it takes years to rear to maturity, before they can be released in to the wild. Keep up the good work."

They were so cheeky and fantastic. If you like zoos, don't go here! This place is all about animals learning to live in the wild and anyone who is just there for a quick photo its not the best for you."

The video at the beginning explains the work being done, the nursery lets you see the youngsters at play and the feeding platform, twice a day, attracts them to where you can get some great pics. All of that and they are free to roam so twice we came face to face with them whilst walking the pathways through the sanctuary. Would recommend and hope you get to see the beautiful apes when there."
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 21 March 2017,Solo,"The reason to come to Sepilok, and the easiest way to see the Orang Utans in a semi-wild setting. It's 30 MYR for foreigners plus a 10 MYR camera fee. You have to leave any backpacks in lockers next to the cinema.There are two feedings, at 10 a.m. and at 3 p.m. Be there 30 minutes before to grab at spot on the ledge for the best view. Both feedings are overcrowded with tourists (well over 100 people) pointing out very obvious things (""He's eating a banana! Wow!""), the afternoon one less so. It's best to watch the Orang Utans for about 15-20 minutes and then head to the outdoor nursery, where a secondary feeding will take place  (meant for teenage  Orang Utans) around 10.30 a.m. Sometimes the Orang Utans migrate from one feeding ground to the next along the walkways - so if you're lucky, you can spot them very much up close (but be careful, they like to steal cameras etc, and I once saw one attach itself to a tourist's back). Leave by 10.45 or 11 a.m. to beat the crowds to the Sun Bear Conservatory next door, which is also absolutely worth it."

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 20 March 2017,,We flew from Kota Kinabalu to Sandakan on the early morning flight (6am)which was easily booked from town. We chose not to pay the $300 plus Australian dollars (we were quoted from the hotel). Instead we just got a taxi from the Hotel to the airport ($60 one way as it was 3am) and then from the airport in Sandakan to Sepilok ($15). The entrance fee was $10 each and we watched the presentation then walked around with everyone and saw the beautiful orangutan and the sun bears. The only complaint we had was when we saw the 10.30 am feeding it would have been nice to have stayed until the 2pm session but there is nowhere to stay. The centre closes down and there is nowhere to sit in comfort and wait. Our flight back was at 8pm so we had a full day to kill. We did go to the War Memorial Park which was well worth a visit. We then went to the Sheridan(the bar did not open until 5pm !!!!) for a bite to eat before our flight. On the whole we had a great day.
3.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 19 March 2017,Couples,"Please keep in mind this is not a zoo, and orangutans are free to roam. Open 9 to 11 and 2 to 4. Feeding times at 10 and 3. Personally? Feeding times were OK, but watching the young ones at the outdoor nursery was hilarious and far more enjoyable. Those are the only two things to do at the center aside from a short video and very limited sinage or information. We respect the rehabilitation intent, but the entrance fee made it feel like they were just trying to charge as much as they could. The camera fees for the center really rubbed us the wrong way. It's a tiny camera and who in their right mind WOULDN'T bring one? We thought they could have done a LOT more in regards to educating people and providing interesting things to do. Can easily pair with the Sun Bears and Rainforest Discovery if you want a full day. "

4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 19 March 2017,Family,Was good to see the orangutan but it was just like any other zoo. Watching them from a platform eating on their platform before they disappeared into the trees. Probably not what I was expecting as I'd been told they come up to the boardwalks and get really close to you. My children enjoyed it and that's the main thing. 
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 19 March 2017,Couples,Worth a visit if you want to see the Orang Utans. Its well layed out and at feeding time there is a good chance of seeing many Orang Utans.

There was an orangutan in the bushes as we entered, this set the rest of the visit as we were walking along walkway and an orangutan walked within 2 foot of us. The outdoor nursery is a great new facility since my last visit and on walking from there to the feeding platform we had the honour of having an orang walk towards us and stand and stare looking into my partners eyes!! Amazing, once in a lifetime event. "

It's somewhere you want to support and are happy giving money to."

Just seeing them up close and not restricted was brilliant. We then went to the feeding platform and saw 3 with baby's who all had their backs to people's cameras, on purpose I hope"

It was so interesting. The nursery is a short walk from the main entrance and has two big viewing rooms (one aircon and one fan) where you can sit and watch the young orangutans play.Just before 3pm we walked around to the feeding platform. There were people there already, but it wasn't packed and there was plenty of space for everyone to move around and take pictures. Being so close to the orangutans was absolutely incredible!

Feeling deflated, we started to walk away and then out of nowhere, 2 large orangutans appeared and the large male attacked a woman a few feet away.  He ripped her clothes off all the way to her panties.   Yes, we saw wild orangutans up close (I kicked and pushed at him to release her).  But the real story here is that is to please REMEMBER that these are WILD AMINALS and to be careful.  I don't know what injuries or claw marks the woman suffered as she quickly left the scene."

It was a short ride to the Sanctuary.On arrival you are invited to a short film, however you MUST leave your shoes outside in the racks.  They do a short presentation on the sanctuary and invite you for a fee to adopt an orang utan for a year.  There is a small shop selling soverneirs.  There is also a small museum, here again you have to remove your shoes.After this you then walk an elevated wooden walkway, although it was very hot, it was surprising cool walking through the forest to where the orang utans come and feed twice a day.  There are two viewing areas.  They do ask that you do not talk and if you do very softly in order not to frighten the monkeys.A chap walks through the forest to put fresh fruit on the platform where the orang Utans eat.  There are a few ropes which are spread out through the forest and you will note when they are on their way as you can see the ropes moving.Was a little disappointed that there were only about 6 orang Utans came.  However it was not long before some other monkeys made their way through on the forest floor with their young ones.  They soon hopped up to get some of the fruit, they were the funniest as the young ones were mucking about, the Orang Utans then disappeared as apparently they do not like conflict with the monkeys.Just beware if you are on the nearer platform as the monkeys come along the ropes overhead and will wee on you if you are not careful.  I saw one but moved out of the way.There are also quite a few snakes in the undergrowth, but didn't espy any.From here, we were taken to the outside nursery, but we were behind glass and the young orang Utans were getting up to mischief with the staff keeping a very close eye on them.Very enjoyable experience and worth getting up early for."

So when you get there head to the reception centre and you pay entry and a small fee for cameras. Then you walk about the back of the reception centre to the start of the board walk. Go slowly and listen. The orang utans use the rails of the board walk as walkways and we where lucky to spot two walking along ahead of us. First stop is the nursery, once inside take the door on the left it's looks like it's private but it's just air-conditioned. After the nursery it's a short walk along the boardwalk to the feeding platform. Get a good comfy spot as you can be waiting awhile as the wild orang utans decide if they are hungry or not. We spent about an hour here and 5 different adults cam and went from the platform picking up treats and 2 youngsters. *** careful not to drop items over the railing into the jungle*** then a short walk out and onto the sun bears across the road.

We were in Sarawak a week ago and it was magical to see these lovely creatures in the wild. It was anti climactic to see the same but in different environment where they are held in a compound to be trained to live in the wild. It is still worth the trip though if you insist in seeing more."
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 7 March 2017,Couples,"This center does incredible work caring for orphaned and formerly captive orangutans and releasing them back into the wild. Its a rare opportunity to see these critically endangered apes at a fairly close distance. Though Borneo is a remote location, there were no shortage of people at the center. There are 100 people or more trying to get a good vantage point for the feeding. If you have an opportunity to go more then once, I would suggest skipping the talk/video the first time and head to the outdoor platform at least 20 mins early to secure a spot at the railing. You can visit the nursery afterwards and see the video in the afternoon. You cannot bring anything inside, so plan to leave your bag in a locker. I was happy we had a guide who could answer all of our questions, but there are some staff around if you go solo. We got lucky with a couple close encounters on the path, but unlucky that no orangs showed up for an afternoon feeding.  However, the nursery is always delightful and full of activity. "

It's a very popular attraction and I found the AM feeding to be overcrowded but because of the interest it's to be expected. The sanctuary have public feedings twice a day and I went during the morning feeding. During my visit two orangutans came over to have a snack and everyone was able to capture great photos. Some people may have expected to see more activity but I was happy to see the two. I then went over to the nursery where I saw about 6 or 7 younger orangutans playing, hanging out and play fighting with one another in their enclosure. Overall it's a highly recommended activity and if you can visit both the AM and PM feedings it'll be worthwhile. "
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 7 March 2017,Couples,Visit began with a 30 min talk and video about the work done at the center (very interesting). We then walked along some wooden walkways through the trees to the viewing platform for feeding time (10am). Sadly many other visitors ignore the signs asking for silence and we're rather noisy  however this didn't seem to put of the 7 Orangutans we saw (including 2 mothers with babies). Watched and took photos for about 30 mins then headed off to viewing building in the nursery and saw 5 more.  Was so interesting watching 3 of the young ones (6 or 7 yrs old) playing/fighting/socializing.  The work done here is fantastic and allowing tourists a view (without contact or closeness unlike some places which I feel is wrong) is a privilege.  Lovely experience and opportunity for people to learn about these marvelous creatures we share so much with.

When we booked this trip we were led to believe we would be seeing orangutans in their natural habitat. We went to a big compound where young orangutans were taught how to survive once they were put in the forest. It was lovely to see but it took all of one hour. We then went on a city tour and saw a temple. ""Boring"" it took from 6 o'clock in the morning to 10 a'clock at night.A very long day for a very short experience with the orangutans.MERV."

You don't need long, 45 minutes or longer if you want to sit and watch them play in the observation area and then catch feeding time (in another location). You have to pay a camera fee here of 10R, like most other places in the area. Very cool experience. "

We got the impression sepilok has more guarantee of orangutan spotting but semmengoh somehow felt more organic. The orangutans seemed very happy though and were very familiar with our gawping so came quite close. Unmissable.

We went just before the feeding time at 3pm, before which we were at the Sun Bear centre next door for their feeding time, so I would say that the best time to get to Sepilok is just after 2pm. There were a couple of adult orang utans that came to the feeding platforms which is quite open and close. They were pretty relaxed and and it was great to watch them. We then went to the nursery where there were at least 5 more orang utams with a couple of trainers, these ones were younger and cuter! All in all, well worth the money spent."

Not everyone go with a tour group. We drove there. We arrived at 12.25pm and found out that it is closed for lunch. So, we had to entertain ourselves till then. We saw four adults in the wild and a few more in the nursery. At feeding time, there was only one. I was told sometimes there would be no orang utan since it is in the jungle. I guess, we were lucky that four came out from the wild. Do take note that there is a fee for camera and no bags or water bottles/containers are allowed to be brought into the sanctuary. It is for safety reasons as the orang utans has in the past grabbed people's belongings."

We saw a lot of Orang Utan in the nursery as at that time they were given bananas. Then at 3pm we moved to the main platform where they give the 'wild' ones bananas, but only one Orang Utan came - anyway, we were not really convinced by the fact that it was a good thing to give them food as a tourist attraction.... The overall visit was disappointing and doesn't last more than 1 hour.However the Sanctuary does a very good job for the conservation of the species, general awareness of the public and healing the one in poor health.."

The office opens at 9:00 am, the video starts shortly after that and is done around 9:30. The morning feeding is at 10:00. You can watch (and hope they turn up) then head to the Toddler room where you can see the young ones playing/learning.   The pattern repeats in the afternoon at 2:00pm. We went in the morning and then again in the afternoon (with a stop for lunch at the cafe on site - better prices than expected, then an hour or two at the sun bear centre nearby).  The morning group included a large and loud package tour, and had 3 orangutan show up. It was annoying trying to shush people in the tour group who weren't following the obvious signs and guide. Based on other reviews, this sounds common.   The afternoon was much quieter and more enjoyable. Orangutan were walking along the path beside us, and 7-9 came for the feeding! Much better experience. If you have to come to only one time slot, go to the afternoon. The sanctuary is well set up, with an obvious focus on the well being of the orangutan there. "

The aim of the sanctuary is to get the orangutans to live in the rainforest without needing human assistance hence why the website says you may not see any on the day you visit. However, we saw 2 that were walked from the nursery and another 4/5 on the feeding platform. It's a fantastic place as it aims to release all of the orangutans back into the wild so you see the staff in the nursery helping the baby orangutans learn to use the ropes to climb and swing from, vs the ones that have already been released and come back for food. Definitely worth a visit."

We arranged the visit independently of a tour company and would highly recommend doing this. You can fly from KK directly to Sandakam for as little as ¬£40 each return on either Malaysia airways or Maswings. We took the 7:10 flight out, its only a 35min flight. On arrival at Sandakam you purchase a taxi voucher to Sepilok for 40 rm our taxi driver offered to come back for us which we would recommend organizing. It's about a 1/2 hour drive to the centre. Arriving at the centre at 8:30, it doesn't open till 9. We purchased tickets for 30 rm each and 10 rm for a camera, really reasonable. We then had a talk by one of the volunteers and watched a short video on the centre which was informative. You have to put all your possessions in lockers provided this is for your own safety and not a big deal.We then went into the reserve and were so lucky to see 3 pigmy elephants, such a massive bonus! Feeding is at 10, again we were so lucky and saw many orangutans and a mother and a baby. Such an amazing experience seeing them in the wild. The 10am slot was really busy and some people can be quite noisy despite silence signs and the guides hushing people. We then walked back to the nursery were you can watch the baby orangutans learning the skills they need to survive in the wild. Again we were so lucky to have two orangutans walking on the pathway in front of us. It was amazing to be so close to these magnificent animals. We had lunch in the cafeteria they have on site, awesome authentic local food and so cheap! We had two currys and rice and drinks for like 20rm. We went to see the sun bears in between the feeding times which we would highly recommend doing as it's literally opposite. We even saw 2 orangutans over there too! We couldn't believe our luck.We returned for the second feeding which was much quieter but not as many orangutans. We then took our taxi back to the airport for our 6:10 flight back to KK.

It's worth spending as long as possible in the glassed viewing area at the nursery as there is no guarantee that any orangutans will come to the feeding area. When we were there only one was feeding - disappointing for viewers but it does mean that they are managing to find food for themselves. Surprisingly the souvenir shop was disappointing and a bit limited. When you arrive you have to leave all bags in the lockers provided.

For the the next 15 minutes we had a private showing and as the rangers came to lure Rosa back into the park Rosa gave us a photo opportunity right out of the movies. Before going to the Orangutans feeding we went to see the sun bears and as we were exiting the office and on the way back the staff said Orangutan and Rosa was out and about again  as if she was checking us out as she hung off the roof of the sun bear sales office.   Apparently the Orangutans visit often!We  wanted to get a good viewing spot at the feeding platform so arrived 1/2hr before the start and prior to all the crowds.  5  to 10 minutes later 5 - 6 Orangutans started to show up from a private feeding session and take advantage of some bananas already left out. This was a much better experience than the main feeding session and with very few people their to witness.We wonder how often that happens and recommend people go early just in case.As our experiences show you can never predicted when an Orangutan will pop up and make an appearance.A wonderful experience, that was much more than we had hoped for."

Negative - some people visiting the sanctuary are so disrespectful but there are not enough assertive staff around to control visitors. For example everywhere you look there are signs saying to be quiet, I can tell you now that people did not respect this which made seeing orangutans in the semi wild like you were in an awful zoo. We witnessed one man trying to touch a pregnant orangutan and he didn't even listen when he was asked to stop. People really need to be told or perhaps should sign an agreement before entering about what is expected of them and staff need to be trained to have the confidence to tell tourists off. I was also disappointed to see that the cafe outside sold all products that contain palm oil. I felt that the sanctuary should have tried to educate people on the palm oil industry and its affect on Borneo's wildlife. Selling products that contain conflict palm oil is supporting the destruction of the orangutans habitat. "

There was crowd but we managed to see 2-3 orang utans who came down for bananas. As we left earlier than most of the crowd, we were very lucky to see an orang utan directly on the boardwalk coming towards the feeding platform. It's definitely not a zoo, and the number of orang utans you see whilst on the board walk is not guaranteed. Go, if you are into nature and animals.

No review will quite to justice to the feeling of seeing these majestic creatures in the wild - high in the trees of the Borneo jungle.

The Orang-Utan is one of the most endangered of Malaysian wildlife species. Found only in Borneo and Sumatra, the Orang-Utans‚Äô survival is constantly threatened by forest fires, felling of trees, poaching and illegal hunting. The Orangutans are fascinating to watch with their all too human expressions and crazy red hair!! They are skillful acrobats and maneuver around the ropes, trees, and vines effortlessly.

For spotting orangutangs it is however better to visit one of the lodges e.g. Sukau. Visiting a lodge you will see the animals in its natural habitat instead of this artificial environment with 300 spectators. Still recommend a visit together with a lodge, if you have limited time, pick a lodge. "

I would recommend not going on an organized tour because you will likely only go to one of the feeding times.  I stayed around for both of the feedings and found that the afternoon feeding has less people and likely more Orangutans.  As a bonus, the Orangutans in the training program might have a walkabout on the boardwalks where you will literally be within arms length of them."

When we got there we got some refreshments from the onsite cafe and then listened to a talk and watched an educational video put on by the centre at 09:00. This lasts for about 40 minutes and is really interesting and informative. They have the talks throughout the day so I recommend you check the timings when you get there. We then went to the 10:00 feeding session. Just one orangutan came but it was still worth seeing. There is plenty of space at the feeding platform so you can take great pictures. After that we went to watch the outdoor nursery which was brilliant. You can watch this until 11:00 as it closes then until 14:00. They have an airconditioned room so you can keep cool while you watch them play. This was great fun and the children loved it. We then had lunch at a resort 5 minutes walk down the road from the rehabilitation centre. The food was fantastic and they serve delicious freshly squeezed juices as well. I really recommend you have your lunch there. After lunch we went to see the sun bears which is opposite the orangutan centre, about a two minute walk away, and then we went back for the second feeding session. The sun bears were brilliant to see also and the guides there were extremely informative. The second feeding session of the orangutans was at 15:00 and this time we saw three wild mothers with their babies. It was an incredible experience and I highly recommend it. I would definitely go back there again. "

After this we took a walk around we saw a snake in the forest. We came back in the afternoon and were even more pleased to see more Orang Utans at the feeding platform, they were enjying their feed, We even saw one outside of the area around the public toilets and he was up to mischief.

2.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 15 December 2016,Friends,"We travelled for over 4 hours to get to the Orangutan Sanctuary, and just outside of the Sanctuary, our guide started to tell us the do's and don't; understandable when you are dealing with wild animals.We were slightly concerned when we were advised that there is a 'naughty' Orangutan who likes pretty ladies and often takes their clothes off, leaving them completely naked.  But in all of those acres of land, what were the chances?As is happens, very high.As we walked round the corner from the feeding station, the 'naughty' boy turned up and was quite aggressive, but we managed to pass in single file and off to safety in the nursery.Taken back into the rainforest, we encountered the 'naughty' Orangutan again.There were six adults in our organised group, with a guide, but there were very many who were not accompanied, who were wandering around aimlessly.So when the 'naughty' Orangutan decided to attack one of the men in our group, we could not move forward as there was a total bottle neck in front of us.Our guide had a whistle, and there was a guard protecting the Orangutans who had a stick, and the guard out-ran the rest of us.This was not a random attack.  We spoke to several guides who advised he does this often, and has ripped the thumb off of a ranger.  He doesn't just take clothes off 'pretty' ladies, but also masturbates on them.  This is not a 'naughty' Orangutan, but a really dangerous, strong and powerful wild animal who does not like men.This was one of the most terrifying experiences of my life.When we did get clear of the area, we were ordered back the way we had come by another Ranger.  I'm not sure if he was aware of the attack, but again we had to pass the Orangutan.The man who was attacked was taken to the caf√© where his wounds were cleaned up by our guide, but there did not appear to be any serious medical help on hand.As Sepilok are aware that this single Orangutan is capable of harming people, I really do not understand why he is still there; or why a serious warning isn't given prior to booking.Unsurprisingly, the attack upset the whole group, and we were nervous throughout the remainder of our time there, unsure of where he was likely to pop up next.Up until this point, the feeding of the Orangutans, and the nursery were lovely, but I am extremely angry that we were not at all protected and the guard ran off.I would not take children to this sanctuary.  The man that was attacked could have caught rabies or any kind of blood poisoning.  The Orangutan could have killed a child."

While they are still vulnerable there is a nursery for very young ones and nursng mothers. None are caged and are free to leave at anytime.There are feeding platforms which can be viewed from boardwalks by the public, but at a reasonable distance (about 200 feet) and interestingly this attracts the occassional complete wild Orang utan. It is clear that this does not create dependency, as most move off into the jungle as they gain in both experience and confidence.We saw 7 on the platforms while we were there, and many more in the nursery area. These are all wheelchair friendly areas. The boardwalks also allow the observation of other forms of wildlife.Care has to be taken - We did note the importance of not getting too close. These are wild animals and will launch grab attacks on bags, cameras etc. Our guide lost his umbrella to one which dived out of the trees and took it.There is a great deal of information available on this British founded work, plus the opportunity to financially support the ongoing efforts to repopulate the region. It is estimated that less than 1500 wild orangs survive in the surrounding rain forests, which given its vastness is not much.Efforts are also being made to establish belts of trees linking the rainforests through the plantations allowing wildlife the freedom to travel without threatening human activities.The cost works out at about $100 each to visit."

So after seeing them in the wild, seeing them at the sanctuary feeding just wasn't as special.

The nature trail at the sanctuary was closed during our visit, which is another reason I only gave it 3/5.  My recommendation would be to go to the Rainforest Discovery center first (it's also way cheaper), and if you don't see Orangutans and other wild life there then go to the Sanctuary.  One benefit of going to the feeding is getting to see the Orangutans up close, getting that close in the wild is extremely unlikely."

I believe that some of them would expect the orangutans coming to sit on their back and walk holding hands.  But it's not about that! It's a recreation of their natural habitat, so that they could feel they're not trapped, it's wildlife that you cannot control so don't moan if you don't encounter the orangutan face to face. Cool sanctuary, it was a pleasure to see those tiny ones playing and a mother orangutan with a baby eating the fruits.  "

However, in this case (as well with the Sunbear Conservation Center), I highly recommend a visit because your admission price serves to not only educate us as tourists/visitors and allow us to spread the word about the plight of the orangutans (and local habitat) but also provide funds to save, rehabilitate and release (when possible) the orangutans.    Admission price is cash only; there is also a camera fee.  You are not allowed to bring anything in, except your camera if you‚Äôve paid the fee; even bottles of water are forbidden to prevent temptation to the great apes.  Please remember that these creatures have been subjected to various levels of contact with humans ‚Äì some are mischievous, some are suspicious, some overly-friendly, so please follow the instructions of the staff when asked to not approach.   A decent visit is at least two hours, which includes walking around the boardwalk, observing orangutans, watching the feeding and visiting the nursery. For this reason alone, I rate this attraction FIVE STARS to encourage everyone visiting the area to support the good work of the Center."

The center was very well run with caring staff and a clear short presentation by the resident official. The orangutans looked healthy and somewhat happy. no sad looking underfed ones.

We went to the morning feeding, and felt a little rushed through the park, and then we were suddenly outside again. We then went to see the sun bears next door, and then we got back in to the orangutans to see the afternoon feeding. We used the same ticket. You must leave your stuff in a locker, and you must pay 10 RM extra to bring your camera. We also went on a nighttrip here at the orangutan sanctuary. We came at 18.00 and went into the senter with torches. We saw many interresting animals. Flying squirrels! Snakes, tree crabs, fruit bat, frogs and lizards. A nightwalk is really interesting. The only thing i did not like, was that they woke up a sleeping orangutan and kept the lights on it for many minutes even if it was obviously bothered by it. Otherwise, a perfect nightwalk. "

In no way would I discourage anybody from going. However I have rated at one to highlight an issue with security at the locker area. On a recent visit we had MR 100 ($24) disappear from our bag which we had placed in the locker, you can not take any bag into the park. We would never normally leave cash in a locker but on this occasion we mistakenly did. We know exactly how much was taken because we knew exactly how much was in it. The fact that small amounts were taken would indicate that we are probably not the first victims but perhaps the first to notice. Therefore I hope this review will save anybody else from the same fate by not leaving any money in the lockers, like we foolishly did and also will hopefully lead the centre to review their security surrounding the lockers!Again please do go as the experience is fantastic, just be careful."

These plantations are extinguishing the biodiversity of the Borneo island. When I visited it there was so many people that it was too noisy. People stood there just taking pictures when one of them went to get the food and after the picture they were just talking out loud and moving around. Once they left, some others got closer even though you couldn't see them. I would recommend to do that. When people moves from the platform to the nursery they are so disrespectful that it sounds like there was a war or something. So loud animals get scared and the personal of the team, instead of telling people to be quiet, are the first ones to make noises. Also, the nursery is just like a circus. It is good but the visitors and the guides attitude, the closed trails (all closed) and the nursery just lower the value to me. Looks like they only look to benefit from it. "

We arrived at opening (9) for the morning feeding session at 10 - this session is usually much busier than the one in the afternoon as this is when all the tour groups visit. I would advise getting into position at the feeding platform at around 9.30/9.40 to make sure you get a good spot. In the morning session we saw about 8 orang utans come and get their breakfast, including a mother and newborn! The activity lasted for about 15/20 minutes before the orang utans disappeared back into the jungle at which point we headed to the nursery.The nursery is where we had the most fun! The babies are so cheeky and playful, you could watch them for hours. There were many moments where the entire room of visitors roared out laughing. As a plus - the nursery has AC which was a blessing for us in the morning sunshine! We were ushered out at 11am and headed to watch the video which, though old, was very interesting.We also returned for the afternoon session as we were in Sepilok for the day. There were much fewer crowds, but equally, less orang utans came to the feeding platform. There was still plenty of activity at the nursery though which was a lot of fun. And we got to see an orang utan up close who was walking along the visitor walkways!FYI, the centre doesn't allow bags so you must leave them in lockers outside, it's therefore best to wear clothing with pockets to carry cameras, water, and a fan.The centre also does a night tour for an extra 30 MYR per person - this can be arranged at the ticket office on the day. We didn't find it to be particularly exciting - other than seeing an orang utan who had escaped the centre perimeter and was eating flowers in the car park outside. We didn't learn/see much more than we had during our Rainforest Discovery Centre walk: a couple of snakes, a gecko, a flying squirrel and a few birds. I wouldn't say that you'd be missing out if you chose not to do it.I would highly recommend viewing these magnificent creatures if staying in Sandakan or Sepilok. We weren't able to see them in the wild during out 4D/3N Kinabatangen trip so we were at least glad that we saw them here!"

Although I did not see anyone touching the animals, I was surprised at how close some people got up to them as both orang-utan and people walked along the walkway. Most people will be respectful of nature, but I worry there is not enough staff around to ensure people (tourists) don't get too close. There was an orang-utan that died by electrocution in the park this year, no one in the staff were able to explain what had happened to this orang-utan.  Also one has disappeared and there was no explanation for this orang-utan either. If you look beyond your simple visit to this location and think what impact is this close encounter having, what are the risks to the animals etc. What conclusions can be drawn?I guess that the exposure and the awareness is all a positive for the visitor to take away, but I found it interesting that I could not find much information on deforestation etc at the centre.As another person has already alluded to: the information boards are very old."

There are no barriers between you & the animals, so you can't take bags in as they are likely to steal things being so close. The park rangers put food on the ledge for orangutans to take if they want to. We then went to the nursery where the younger ones are - watched them playing on the ropes & eating too. We then went over to see the sun bears, before returning in the afternoon. We had lunch in the cafe, then watched a video & talk about the work of Orangutan Appeal UK who work with Sepilok.

Shortly after we started down the boardwalk we encountered our first orangutan just playing in the trees close to the boardwalk.  There was a ranger near by watching to ensure that none of the visitors got too close to the orang-utan nor did he get too close to us (more about this a bit later)!  After that we went to the feeding platform area to watch them swing in from the forest to get their meal.  There were no more than two on the platform at any one time, but we did see about a half dozen come in from the forest.  It really depends on what is fruiting in the jungle at the time of your visit as to how many show up for the feeding.  After the morning feed, we then went to the outdoor nursery where the younger orangutans are taught to swing from ropes etc.  The viewing area here is inside in order to keep the tourists away from the younger orangutans. Watching them play and eat was a really incredible experience and we were quite mesmerised by it.  Back to the rangers, they are positioned on the boardwalks in order to keep both the orangutans and the tourists safe.  on our way to the indoor nurses, one lady ignored the warnings and tried to get in very close and the orangutan promptly grabbed her and then stole her phone to play with.  Be forewarned, they are very very strong and are quite fond of phones, cameras hats etc.  You may or may not get your lost article back.  Our unfortunate lady did get her phone back eventually but it had been bitten a few times and was in somewhat rough condition.  After our morning, we ate lunch at the small restaurant on site.  The food is local and quite tasty and very reasonably priced.  As we had some time before the afternoon feeding we visit the sun bear sanctuary across the road, another worthwhile visit.

Having the feeding viewing time allows us humans to see them up close and interacting in ways that would be almost impossible for the majority of us to see otherwise.  Orangutans stay with the mother about 6 yrs, so when separated they die. The center receives young orangutans (some as young as 1 yr) and they seem to have a high success rate of 70% release. Exposing them to us humans is necessary in order to raise educational awareness and funds to continue the work. Well done!"

So high was my expectation of a ""Dian Fossey"" moment that it all came crashing down. No, I am not expecting to be entertained (reason at the last paragraph)  . But if you have the expectation to be ""entertained"" by Orang Utan shows... you will be downright disappointed. This is a rehabilitation center, not a zoo or circus. The Orang Utan DON""T perform tricks. Rather visitors are treated to observing the primates as they go about their activities, from a safe distance.I was told by my local guide, that even during the two feeding session at 10am and 3pm, visitors may be disappointed by the primates ""no-show"", as the primates may choose to feed elsewhere among the forest ground. But possibility of them are high as a readily available meal is an attractive option. :) The park is well designed and certainly worth a visit, as the objective of the center is a noble one and any fund helps in the primates survival. Now the reason for my disappointment...is one important note to all visitors, particularly, PHOTOGRAPHERS...all bags, camera bags included, are disallowed to be brought into the park. Reason being that in the past, certain visitors had their bags grabbed by Orang Utans  along the boardwalk. Compensation for the lost items were sought and resulted in much hassle. So photographers, bring with you your camera body + zoom lens - 70-200mm, 300mm, 100-400mm, etc, will be good. Or have a companion carry another lens. You can imagine my bag of gears with six lenses (except one carried in) all languishing in the locker, which is provided and complimentary. Have a great day with the Orang Utans :) Enjoy ... (^___^)"

It was such a pleasure to see the young orangs enjoying their breakfast and having a play.You don't get to be up-close to the animals, you see them from a little distance but there is a good reason for this... They are trying to rehabiliate these orangutans so that they're able to go off and live freely (although they still have a lot of free rainforest space at the centre) so they don't want them becoming too used to humans. Anyone who isn't happy with this situation is missing the whole point of the initiative. They do great work here and long may it continue."

There is never any guarantee you'll see orangutans; on my second visit 3 years ago we only saw 2. But this time we had a full show of 11 orangutans, including a baby with his mum who loved making friends with the older orangutans. As we were leaving, we saw that we could visit the outdoor nursery, but we only just got there as it was closing. This was a new addition since the last time we visited so we hadn't left enough time so this is something I'd definitely recommend doing in the future. "

It is very well managed and the walkways and viewing platforms are walk/wheelchair friendly. Although it feels a little fake because of all the tourists it is a place where Orang-utans who would otherwise be ill-treated live a free life.Seeing them close up is a real treat but seeing them in the wild was a different experience altogether which you need to go into the jungle to experience. If you are short on time then it is worth the trip out of Sandakan.

2.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 6 October 2016,Couples,"I really don't know where all those good recommendations come from. We planned our trip to Sepilok along with a two nights stay in Sandakan because it is pointed out as some real highlight both in travel guides and on the internet. In fact it's just like some small zoo which you could have anywhere. Not knowing about what we would experience here we did a 330km journey by taxi.When you enter Sepilok you quickly reach the famous (artificial) feeding platform where hundreds of people with smart phones and cameras waiting for the best shot of the feeding scenario which is by the way around 20-30 metres from where you can observe everything. If you want to take a real nice picture, forget about any GoPro or compact camera. Without a zoom you won't get that far...Anyway, a family of Orang Utans came and ate which was nice. We decided to leave the observation area before the animals do so to avoid moving on in a huge crowd of tourists. After only some minutes of walking through the forest without having the chance of seeing any more monkeys due to visitors' noise you reach the nursery area where you get some background information on the different Orang Utans and you can observe an artificial playground where (by chance) monkeys play with ropes and old tires or eat - all through huge windows. As the walking path ends in this direction you are forced to go back. Normally there would be the bird trail half-way back, a two kilometres trail which was closed. Some security wasn't able to tell us why. Another few minutes of walking later we reached the exit and entrance area again. Well, and that's the whole story of Sepilok. Still we wanted to know more about the closed trail which we planned to walk on and so I spoke to one of the staff who explained that this trail has been closed for two months now. There was neither any hint regarding this closing on their website nor has it been communicated through their staff when purchasing the ticket - at a regular rate and not discounted. The man we spoke to reffered to some small paper stripe that sticked on a glass wall at the ticket counter informing about the closed trail. Well, firstly there are around 10 different stickers and information posts and secondly this short information reaches people visiting the place only at their final arrival and not anywhere in advance. Putting this information on their website would have been helpful.Don't get blended by the dozens of HQ pictures on their website or other advertisements for Sepilok, just avoid this rip-off - at least if you are planning to go to Sandakan just for this purpose. Sepilok is just a very small zoo, not more than that."
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 6 October 2016,Friends,"I rushed to get to the centre for the 10am feeding but it was absolutely packed & there were large groups of people who would not adhere to the 'silence' rule which meant that no orang-utans actually turned up for the morning feed. There is another at 3pm so I decided to attend that also. In the meantime, the nursery is worth a visit & the sun bear sanctuary is next door also. For the 3pm feed, there were a lot fewer people around & already a couple of orang-utans, including a mum with baby, hanging out in the surrounding trees! Five or six turned up for the afternoon feed & it was fantastic to see them so close. I also bumped into one just sitting on the handrail of the walkway shortly after this.The sanctuary is well worth a visit, but don't rush it - it is good to plan spending the day in the area to avoid disappointment."

When I went there (september 2016) all the tracks were closed - they can't say for how long -, no more possibile to walk inside the jungle and see the wildlife. As they told me at the counter, only go the platform and see how they feed the orang-utan, and that's it. You can also go to see the babies. That's not the way to enjoy wildlife and to be educated to truly enjoy nature. The information centre is old and lacking informations. There are 2 feeding sessions (10 am; 3 pm) but after the morning session the center will close until 2pm. Really poor."

Take some time away from the tour groups to soak up the jungle atmosphere and return to the feeding area before departure for a quieter more intimate viewing."
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 2 October 2016,Couples,"My partner and I visited the sanctuary before doing a nature tour on Kinabatangan River, so we planned our trip in September when there is the best chance of seeing Orang-Utans in the wild. This is because the fruit on the trees is in season so they are closer to the river, and also means that it is the time of year when you are least likely to see them in the sanctuary, because they are less reliant on the food provided there. The sanctuary is set in a large area of the forest, and not completely enclosed so the Orang-Utans are encouraged to eventually stop coming back to the feeding platforms by giving them the same 'boring' food every day. It is good that the sanctuary prioritises the rehabilitation of the animals over the enjoyment of tourists. The best time to visit is either by 10am or 2pm, when the food is put out for them. We saw 2 young Orang-Utans at the morning feed, but apparently a lot of people don't plan their visit for feeding time and do not see any. There is a nursery you can view though where younger ones are cared for, but this area is more zoo-like, as they are kept separate and looked after by the staff, with man-made play areas and things. Even though we did manage to see wild Orang-Utans after our visit to the sanctuary, I'm still glad we came here. It's a great place to see and learn about them in their natural habitat, although it definitely is busy there at feeding time! There are also 7 pygmy elephants at the sanctuary at the moment, which we glimpsed through the trees."

The ranger on the night walk was fantastic. He'd worked there for 26 years and was very knowledgeable. When viewing the Orangutans go to the small viewing platform on the left and stand in the top right corner for the best view. Everyone should visit the rehabilitation centre. We must all do our utmost to save these beautiful creatures.

Later joined by a male but friendly together.

Surely if you're going to travel all this way you are much better off seeing wildlife in their natural habitat!? I felt especially uncomfortable in the 'nursery' area, viewing the young orangutans through a glass window felt very americanised and all very forced. Perhaps if you take away 75% of the tourists pressing their phones up to the window to get a slightly lesser than average photo, it might have felt a little more special. We didn;t see too many Orangutans either, which is to be expected and probably a good thing they are actually out enjoying the large sanctuary rather than being forced to stay near the tourists. However, huge kudos to the sanctuary for working to preserve these fantastic animals and in finding a way to funding this fab work. It's certainly worth a visit if you would like to learn more about them and don't mind the touristy element, just make sure you get out to the jungle too to see so much more of what Borneo has to offer! :)"

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 25 September 2016,Couples,"We loved it here! We took a public minivan bus from Sandakan early in the morning (about 7am). We took a local minivan from the minivan bus station and it dropped us at Sepilok junction. It was a 3km walk from there to The orangutan centre, but it was an easy, flat, straight walk that we enjoyed. We arrived at 8:30 and had a coffee in the cafe. You can otherwise take a direct local bus from Sandakan at 9am but we thought that might be cutting it fine for the 10am feeding. We took a direct minivan back from the centre at 12:30 I think (there are two a day, the staff can advise. I think the other one is around 16:00). The centre itself is great. You can watch a short video about their work, which is interesting, and then wander around the boardwalks at your leisure. The wooden boardwalks are literally through the jungle, and aside from the baby nursery section (not open to visitors), the orangutans are free to roam. We were lucky enough to see a couple playing on the board walk in front of us!A couple of orangutans came to the feeding platform for the feed, which was nice. There was a screaming child when we went which doesn't help the atmosphere and can scare the orangutans. You aren't guaranteed to see the wild orangutans when you visit as they have space to roam as they please in the jungle, but we did and there were quite a few playing in the outdoor nursery too so it seems they are around often.We had a great and memorable morning here and I recommend a visit - it's a special experience to see the semi-wild orangutans at home!"

This would be really sad if it was the only contact with orangutan on a trip to Borneo. The nursery was good to see but it is basically a zoo environ. The other thing to note is that you can get in and out of this place in about 90 minutes, I went with the idea that it was going to be several hours but it's actually very quick. We went in time for the morning feeding at 10am and then went to the nursery which closes at 11am. I suggest if no orang turn up for the 10am feed head straight to the nursery and watch the young ones come up for breakfast. The most important thing is to get out into Borneo and see the environment (& the threats to the environment by Palm Oil). We caught a taxi from Sandakan (return trip 120rm) and paid at the door. Seems to be the cheapest way to go."

They are in rehabilitation so will only come for food when they want to.  We were lucky that we saw about 9 in the morning and about 5 in the afternoon. The nursery is a joy to watch with some very cheeky characters. The work these guys do is amazing.  Things to note if you are not on a tour. It's RM 40 for a taxi to the sanctuary. Out taxi driver wanted to stay with us for the day and take us around but we declined the offer as we wanted to stay at the sanctuary and go to the sun bear centre across the road. That said, we were at the sanctuary for 8.30 am, watched the video and went in at about 9.45 am. Got a great view of the platform ( it's definitely a lot busier for the morning feed) - but they had all left by 10.30am. Half an hour at the nursery and you are all ushered to the exit as it closes 11am -2.30pm. We went across to the sun bears and spent about 90 mins in there - which was very enjoyable. Kind of wished we had kept the taxi driver but ended up walking to the discovery centre ( 20 min walk) which was fabulous. We saw some more Orangutans, large squirrels and walked along the canopy ( well worth a visit and only ¬£3 to get in.) Walked back to watch the afternoon feeding at the sanctuary before getting a taxi ( there were plenty around) to the airport. Great day and would recommend a visit. "

The favourite and most popular area seemed to be the viewing station for all the young orang-utans who you can watch coming out of the forest and play on the centre's climbing frames and eat some of the food left out for them, and of course a chance to watch them play and interact with each other. Another popular viewing area was an early morning feeding station on a platform in the jungle where you could gather and watch the orang-utans quietly emerge from the jungle and eat and then disappear back into the jungle once full.

Beautiful surroundings, educational video if you are interested in learning more about what they do, and the gift shop is lovely. Passionate staff work here - have a chat to the Orangutan Appeal UK liaison on your way out for more information on what goes on. I would suggest spending a day here just in case you don't see as many orangutans as you were hoping for in the morning :)"

I would suggest spending a day here - if you don't see many orangutans in the morning you can try again in the afternoon. The jungle is astounding, and there is the chance to see all kinds of wildlife. If you're the type of person who likes to appreciate the surroundings without many people you can arrive a bit earlier than the scheduled feeding times for some peace and quiet :) The educational video they show is also something I would recommend - it gives you an insight into the work they do and how important it is."

We saw 3 adults and 5 babies in the nursery and spent a good couple of hours watching.  You can't take anything in with you (bag, water etc) and it was a really hot day so we struggled a bit without anything to drink, but it was worth it to see orang-utans.  It was extremely crowded with coach parties galore and feeding time was just a gathered mass of tourists, but worth it for the main attraction."

That meant when we got a grumpy orangutan in the morning we were free to return in the afternoon and see some more.They are wild so may not show at all. We got there early to the viewing platform and I would reckoned this. They seem to come to the platform and have a look to see if there is any food and if not swing away. The nursery for younger beasts was brilliant. Could of stayed for hours watching them play/ fight and learn how to swing.I also like what they are doing on a moral level. They are free to come and go. If none turn up for feeding it's a good thing (for them) in that they are learning to find their own food.All in all I had a fantastic time and it was very special.

If you want to see orangutans, you have to be very lucky and very patient to try to catch them in the wild so this is the next best thing. Some reviewers complained that they didn't see any orangutans when they visited, even at feeding times (10am and 3pm), and I don't know how this is even possible. We went to both feedings and the platform was swarmed with orangutans. One even walked along the path railing, just in front of us! In the afternoon, we were on our way to the nursery and there were several orangutans that were playing in the trees, just a few meters away from us. The nursery is simply adorable. Definitely be sure to stop by to see the babies after the feedings!The visitor center has plenty of information about the sanctuary and why it's so important to protect this endangered species. They even screen a short film every hour.The center is closed from 12:00 to 14:00 but you can have lunch in the cafeteria. The food is good and reasonably priced."

Two appeared and had their meal, any left overs were quickly eaten by an army of monkeys who had been hovering on the sideline ready to pounce.  As we left the feeding platform and walked to the exit, a keeper came along with an Orang Utan walking on the fence beside him.   To see one of these incredible animals so close up was amazing.Later in the afternoon we returned to view the nursery.  The young Orang Utans were very funny.  Two of them were play fighting and rolling around and even though the keepers separated them they went straight back to each other to carry on.  I could have sat there all afternoon they were so entertaining.We booked this day tour through Joe at Rustic Borneo, the tour also included a trip to the Proboscis Monkey Sanctuary and the Sun Bear Conservation Centre.

The centre is right next to the bear sanctuary which is also very much worth a visit. You have to make a bit of an effort to see the Orangutans and get up close. we hated the Nursery area, loved the feeding platform and spent a bit of time walking between sanctuary and nursery and had a whole group of urangutans walk next to us (ie within a metre). Our driver for the day was Mr Arshad, who is an extremely warm, enthusiastic and knowledgeable guide. I would thoroughly recommend his sservices."
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 3 September 2016,Couples,"This is a rehabilitation centre for orphaned and injured Orangutans. It has a history of doing good work and although the animals are free to come and go as they please, offers visitors guaranteed viewings of Orangutans at reasonably close quarters at feeding time. It is by nature a little of a manufactured experience and does not compare to seeing these wonderful creatures in the wild, but that of course takes a little more effort and a bit of luck to achieve.You are not allowed to take anything into the centre with you (even water bottles) and lockers are provided foc for storage."
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 3 September 2016,Family,"Coincidentally, we visited on International Orangutan Day which added a certain poignancy to experiencing these wonderful animals and finding out more about the work being done to rehabilitate them.I would agree with an older post that advocates doing a DIY trip rather than paying for a tour. It is an unnecessary expense. We were a group of 8 based in KK. We flew out on the 7am flight and back on the 6.15pm flight. (not available everyday) At Sandakan you get a taxi coupon from the taxi counter RM40 one way. Taxis seat 4 persons max. Your taxi driver will quite keenly suggest he picks you up and takes you to see various other sights - up to you if that is what you want. We didn't want that but both drivers willingly came back to pick us up at 4pm when Sepilok closes. They were on time and we paid RM40 back to the airport. We arrived before the ticket office opened (9am) so had a drink and breakfast in the cafe. On purchasing our tickets (RM30) we then put our belongings in the lockers (free) and watched the introductory video (air conditioned room - lovely!) We also got a bit of info. about the different orangs we might see up at the nursery - names and characteristics. You exit the film at 9.40am, plenty of time to wander along the boardwalk for the 10am feeding time. We were lucky to have a couple of orangs playing on the covered roof at the viewing area prior to feeding time as well as seeing plenty on the platform. Following that we wandered to the nursery area - a choice of 2 areas to sit (air-con or not). Both behind glass but both with a great view. On Fridays the centre closes at 11am rather than 12pm but we were happy to go back and get a drink at the cafe again. We then went to the sun bear sanctuary across the driveway. (see separate review) We returned to the cafe for lunch and went back to see the orangs when the centre reopened at 2pm. The difference between am and pm feeding times for us - significantly quieter in the afternoon, less orangs on the main feeding platform but included a mother and very small baby, the orangs at the nursery were super playful and lively in the afternoon. It was mesmerising to watch and an absolute joy! We were also very lucky to have orangs walk along the boardwalk right by us so we got a really close view. It is well worth the RM30 even if you choose not to go back in the afternoon. So total cost per person for us worked out at RM50 - compare that to an organised trip. You don't need a guide to accompany you in the centre its all perfectly straightforward and the taxi drivers will take you wherever you want for a lot less. Cafe is good value, they don't inflate their prices in the way one might expect bearing in mind they have a captive market. The additional trail was closed when we visited so we could only walk to the main feeding platform then to the nursery, then out. No suggestion as to why or when it might reopen.  A great day was had by all!"

We visited twice and the first visit we were rewarded by seeing two small Orangs building a nest in the trees near by to the board walk. Despite pointing this out to several passers by, most were disinterested, more focussed on getting to the nursery for feeding time. Feeding time at the nursery was great fun, but there are hoards of tourists, so be prepared for this, and just enjoy the sight of Orangs swinging themselves in from the forest and playing and enjoying the moment. This was our first sight of Orangs, there were many more to come, but this place is very special. Highly recommended. "
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 2 September 2016,Couples,"We enjoyed our day here but it wasn't quite what we were expecting. Your ticket covers you for the full day, however you can only actually get in the park during the feeding times and then you are escorted out. We waited in the morning at the feeding platform  for quite a long time before 1 organutan appeared. We were then told by a member of staff that we should move on and see the babies in the nursery before closing time. When we arrived there we only had 10minutes before we were escorted out of the building and indeed out of the whole park. Luckily as we were staying next door we were able to go back in the afternoon. We did see more organutans at the feeding platform but couldn't stay long as we wanted to get to the nursery before that closed. I am still unsure as to why these things both happen at the same time, as visitors can't be in 2 places at once. Although it was nice to see the babies In the nursery it was through glass so felt a bit like being at a zoo. We also paid extra and went back at 6pm for a night tour. We saw 2 orangutans here as well as flying squirrels, snakes and spiders."

After feeding, we met more than on orang utan strolling along the boardwalk, almost close enough to touch. Just amazing. Also lots of birds, squirrels and insects to see if you can tear your eyes away from the bigger stuff.

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 25 August 2016,Couples,"I like that we were warned at the start that we might not see any orang-utans. This is what is being aimed for as it shows they are foraging for themselves and not needing food from the feeding stations, so are becoming ready to be released into the wild. It showed the Sanctuary is there for the benefit of the orang-utans not for the entertainment of humans! The Sanctuary feels fairly 'wild' as it's a huge area with walkways enabling access to a wide area including the feeding station. It was very busy when we were there (expected being August) but we were still able to see these amazing animals swing in for the food left by the Rangers there. Apparently they are given the same 'boring' food everyday in order to encourage the orang-utans to look for variety themselves.(If you're not on a tight schedule then I believe it is quieter to visit for the afternoon feeding time as the tour groups come in the morning)There is also a much more contained 'nursery' for young orang-utans, who are delightful, but it does feel more like a zoo.

It was quite touristy, as we expected, and felt the fees were slightly expensive. However, I am convinced they play an important role in conservation and educating the public about this so the money does go to a good cause. Do not expect to see many orangutans- the less that turn up for feeding the more positive this is as it proves the rehabilitated orangutans are coping well in the wild. In the nursery we did see staff hitting the apes with sticks (not violently) which was a bit concerning however. We were lucky enough to see a wild orangutan on kinabangatan river during our trip, so if you can see them in the jungle I'd recommend that more. "

We came there for the morning feeding and were lucky enough to enjoy a company of playful male and female apes.

Yes, there is more tourists than orangutans but the sign at ticket office says clearly that they are migrating between the wild and feeding platforms (where you can take their photos) so you may see lots or none at the feeding stations. We saw only 3 at feeding platform at 10.30am but that was the privilege of seeing them. Also saw one when walking on the walkways between areas and she (the orangutan) was charming and cheeky trying to steal a man's cap from her overhead perch and I got lots of photos of her & close up. Also saw 5 at the nursery where the juveniles prefer to come to feed and play with a keeper/ carer. I liked the care the Sanctuary and carers take with their charges and this place's philosophy is rehabilitation of the monkeys back to the wild, not for paying tourists to gawp at them on mass so I applaud  if tourists see 'less monkeys than they had hoped' and the Sanctuary concentrate on the rehabilitation work."

We only went to this sanctuary so I don't really have anything to compare it to. But we saw loads of young as well as a few larger adults in their natural habitat. The public are not allowed near them which is a very good thing in my view. Wonderful experience! The sun bear sanctuary is beside the facility so easy to do both.

The staff are lovely and all passionate about organ-utan conservation and rehabilitation, however the preconceived perception that I had of this location was very different from what we saw.There is a lovely boardwalk through the jungle, where the orang-utans are able to learn about the jungle and what will be there new home when they are released, however what I found was that many of the other guest were more interested in finding the observation area and the feeding area, and didn't look around them, as we saw a pair of young orang-utans making nests. Due to certain members of the community being naughty and taking the belongings of previous guests, there are rangers dotted around the boardwalk, to protect the orang-utans from the guests as well as the other way around! I found it rather amusing that there are silent signs up, as you are walking in the orang-utan area, however as soon as you step onto that part of the boardwalk, your steps begin to make the most noise due to the covering to prevent slipping on said boardwalk! Once we had made our way to the outdoor nursery, we were greeted by the hordes of other tourists that sat up at the glass watching the juvenile orang-utans. Dont get me wrong, they are very cute and highly amusing, however for me the whole experience was some what underwhelming... Yet I would still recommend this centre to anyone who visits Sabah or this area of Borneo, because although for me the experience wasn't what I had expected, the work that they do at the centre is imperative for orang-utan conservation and supporting them can make the difference!"
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 13 August 2016,Solo,"This rehabilitation centre takes orphaned orangutans and teaches them the skills they would have learned from their mothers to survive in the wild - like climbing. Once they're ready, they are slowly encouraged to go further into the wild via a network of ropes. Many rehabilitated Orangutan's still use these ropes to come back and feed. This is necessary for some of them because due to deforestation, they aren't always able to find enough food in the wild. Feeding time therefore provides an opportunity for visitors to see these wonderful apes, with whole we share 96.4% DNA. I was worried this would feel a little like a zoo but the centre is amazing and the rehabilitated apes are completely free to go as far away or stay as close to the centre as they wish. The nursery area, where the younger orangutan's are, is a great place to watch youngsters be naughty, annoy each other and call fall over.I arrived at 9am and watched the video which finished just before 10am feeding time, then headed to the nursery until 11 when they close for 3 hours. This is a good time to go to the Sun Bear Sanctuary which is opposite. You can then use your ticket to go back to the Orangutan's at 2pm for the 3pm feeding. "
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 12 August 2016,Friends,"I had hoped to see an orangutan in the wild on my trip to Borneo, but it's nearly impossible with them being on the critically endangered list. So I stopped by Sepilok for an afternoon feeding time observation. They show a short film to guests prior to the feelings to explain their rescue and release process. During the feeding times, there are a couple of places to observe orangutans. At the outdoor feeding platform where the orangutans are free to move about as they please, including near the humans if they choose. And the nursery for younger orangutans who are not yet allowed to roam freely. These must be observed from a building behind glass.There were a couple of things I didn't like about Sepilok. Before the feeding they tell you to be very quiet at the platform and not use flashes on your camera, which makes sense. There are also signs stating this. Yet many of the tourists were ignoring these rules and none of the surrounding staff did anything about it. That made me doubt the intentions of the ""sanctuary"".Also I found some soap for sale in the gift shop that was made with palm oil. The primary reason orangutans are critically endangered is that their habitat is being destroyed to make way for palm plantation to feed the worlds demand for palm oil. So why would this place sell a product made with the ingredient that is killing the orangutans that they are rescuing?"

It wasn't too crowded when we went and there were quite a few orangutans out and about which apparently is quite lucky as sometimes they are nowhere to be seen.  It isn't too badly priced but you must pay a small fee (10RM) to bring a camera in.  You must also be aware that you cannot take any bags, water bottles or anything else in with you.  We were disgusted and embarrassed by the bad manners of some winging English people when we were there as they were being very rude to the staff when they were told about this rule.  The reason this is in place is to ensure that the orangutans don't grab things off people and eat or drink whatever as it can make them very sick - a perfectly good reason to leave your things in one of the free lockers in my opinion.The orangutans look like they are well looked after and the sanctuary is probably one of the best animal exhibitions I've ever been to.

We went in the early afternoon and visited the sun bears first. Well, three orang utans (one couple and a competing male) had made their way into the sun bear area. (the orang utans have freedom to roam anywhere they please in this rainforest reserve, so they are considered semi-wild), so the employees were trying to keep the human visitors out of the way as the male/female pair were WALKING along the raised walkway! (see my pics!) We ended up being herded back into the glass enclosure where we bought out tickets and the orang utans were trying to get in!! it was seriously incredible. So smart. The couple was arguing :-), the male was pulling the female around and she was yelling at him as she clearly wanted to go another direction. It was amazing. Anyway, we saw several orang utans. There is a feeding platform at 10am and 3pm, sometimes they come, sometimes they dont. on their website it says its a good thing if they don't come because that means they are fending for themselves and living naturally in the reserve. There were also elephants there but they were not allowed to be seen. This place seems like it really is doing good for these poor animals that humans have failed miserably by destroying their habitat, keeping them as pets, or hurting them because they are stepping foot on their palm oil plantations. ugh.

Once he past he made his way towards the other side of the fence and went out of view. That's when we made our way to the nursery where we got to see like 8 young orangs playing and gave us lots of laughs.

Some of the orangutans revert to the wild, but the majority stay in the area so it is a good opportunity to get to experience these amazing semi-wild animals in their natural habitat. We were in the area for a couple of days before heading onto the Kinabatangan river for three nights so we went into the rehabilitation center in the morning and again in the afternoon. The afternoon is defiinitely the better time to visit because all of the tour groups are there for the morning tour. There is also a sun bear area at the Rehabilitation Center so if you can visit the sun bears in the morning and the orangutans in the afternoon, you will have a much more enjoyable experience."

We were advised not to carry any bags or umbrellas to eliminate the possibility of being snatched by the orangutans that roam freely in the center. We arrived just before the video session at 9.30am and proceeded to the video room opposite the ticketing counter. After the half an hour video show casting the effort to conserve and rehabilitate the orangutans, we entered the area and walk on to the feeding platform. The workers placed some fruits on the feeding platforms for the orangutans to come freely and feed themselves. It was very crowded and the voices from the visitors may have kept the orangutans away. We only managed to see a few monkeys coming to get some food. After waiting for quite some time, we decided to proceed to the nursery area. We managed to see a few orangutans feeding, playing and exercising at this area. There‚Äôs a playground complete with hanging ropes for them to learn and train on their survival skills in the wild. We spent quite some time here to see the orangutans at a close proximity despite through the glass panels. Many visitors just kept on snapping photos and capturing videos. The only rule here is to keep sounds and voices to the lowest in order not to agitate or scare away the orangutans that decided to come forward.  There‚Äôs some display of the names and characteristics of the orangutans in the center. Try spotting them if you do have close encounter with them around the walkway.  It‚Äôs great to learn about the effort being put in to conserve the orangutans who otherwise will be extinct by now. The rehabilitation effort in retraining them to be able to survive in their natural habitats is a very long route but will definitely be seeing the fruits of the hard work by the officers and the volunteers. To help the center, public and visitors can adopt an orangutan or donate to the center. It‚Äôs a good place to visit to learn about the orangutans and to see them at close proximity."

There are 80-90 orang utans in over 400 hectares of open jungle. Visitors spend time watching an old but informative video about the rehab project. There is also a fairly interesting small museum. You then walk through the jungle to viewing platforms at the feeding stations. You may or may not see any orang utans. We were lucky enough to see 9. Two juveniles playing in the jungle, a male, mother and young one at the feeding station and 6 younger ones at the nursery. We loved it. We booked the day trip from Australia via Borneo holidays in Brisbane. I suspect we were taken for a very expensive ride as the day for 4 adults cost $2000. Flights were about 1/2 this but the day trip itself can be booked much cheaper once in Borneo. Entry is approx $10AUD  and the lunch "" included"" on our tour came to less than $10 AUD each. To hire a van and driver for the day try Exotic Borneo and costs  less than $300 AUD for 8 hours. I think if I had known all this I would have saved over $500.

The Sanctuary takes in abandoned or orphaned orang-utans and raises them up to be released into the wild. They have two main areas to view the orang-utans as tourists. The first is the nursery where the youngest orang-utans are fed and taught how to climb. We saw around 10 young ones eating and playing from behind some sound proof glass. Once the orang-utans have been allowed into this area (after a couple years of age) they can venture as far into the jungle as they want. From here there is no enclosure. When they are young they typically stay close by for comfort but as they get older they venture further and further out, with some never coming back as they are happy in the wild. The second place to view them is deeper in the jungle they have another feeding area and this is visited by some of the older Orang-utans (if they are feeling like coming, no guarantees here!) Amazing to see them in such close proximity whilst knowing they are not actually enclosed. We also bumped into some swinging through the branches over the walkways between the areas. Great place and great work."

We were educated to know this is a good result, it means the animals are fending for themselves in this huge sanctuary.

Apparantly it is a good thing if they don't come for food as it means they are fending for themselves in the wild.It was a great experience - but seeing them truly wild in Kinabatangan was a whole different experience and I strongly recommend it if you can.As you have to leave all bags, water etc in lockers it isn't pleasant in such hot weather, my husband had been a little unwell and is also diabetic so had to leave the sanctuary early during feeding as he needed water and to test his blood sugars so this is worth being aware of."

The feeding sessions are crowded, many people ignore the 'Silence' signs, and also many people take young children who make a racket and ruin the experience for the rest. We were lucky, arriving too late for the feeding session on our first visit we actually did get to see a couple of them close up, and they were extremely entertaining."

On a good day you can see many oragutans including the young ones veiwed behind a large  glass widow which gives everone a great veiw in the nursery . The feeding platform for the adults  is also is a great experience  we saw 2 adults one with a tiny baby . The ticket is for the day so if you are staying near by you can go back for the afternoon feeding which is not as busy as the morning. We did this and saw 3 adults on the feeding platform. I guess we were extremely lucky as the orang utans can go and come as they  please as this is not a zoo in any way shape or form ! The sun bears were also amazing  don't miss them gorgeous and so cute . Expensive but so worth it .

Unfortunately we almost had no orangutans join us but 1 did show up for about 5 minutes during the last part of the hour. The tour groups were all rushed out after 15-30 min so we were down to about 20 people from 200 by then. We then went for a short hike down the bird trail (1.5km) that's open on-site until 2pm and less than 300 meters into the hike we were joined by another orangutan, right beside the path!  He hung out with us watching him fascinated for over 10 min, it was amazing. Returning from the hike we ran into another 2 orangutans right around the same area. One of them came down and started walking on the pathway, we moved aside for him and he walked right beside us! The 3pm feeding had 3 more orangutans show up as well as another who came onto the platform. And don't miss the nursery where the juveniles have an outdoor area to play with each other in. It's not fenced in at all so they are free to come and go as they please, just like the adults. Really a fantastic place, don't miss it.Recommendation: If you can only do 1 feeding time go in the afternoon, it seems to have better luck overall. And make time for the hiking trail, you may have an up close encounter with an orangutan if you're lucky!"

We arrived in time for the video explaining the orangutan and the purpose of the centre.  Then we proceeded to the first feeding platform. We witnessed two orangutans having breakfast.  Then on to the nursery where we watched 8 young orangutans having food and playing with each other and on the playground.  It was mesmerising and we stayed for a long time just watching them play and taking many pictures.On the walk back to the centre we came across a orangutan sitting on the railing of the boardwalk. It was so close we could touch it. We were warned to keep back as they love to steal your sunglasses and cameras. This was an experience I will treasure forever.

After traveling so far to see them, we were hoping for a close encounter in the wild.  Unfortunately, there were very few orangs at the feeding station and our only close up was behind glass at the nursery.  While this was fun and amusing, we couldn't help feeling we could have done it all at a zoo anywhere in the world.  Still, worth the visit."

We could walk to the sanctuary in just a couple of minutes and after a delayed flight we managed to race there for the 3pm feed. We were recommended to go visit in the afternoon as the morning is very busy as full of tour groups. Entrance is about ¬£7 each for adults. There are two main areas, a feeding area and the nursery. The feeding area is a viewing platform where we could see the the adult orangoutangs that are in the main area of the reserve, this is located outdoors and can get a little wet. The nursery is where there is a kind of playground where the smaller orangutang that are still being trained to help them if possible back to the wild.  In this area you are indoors and view them through a glass screen.  It was great to see these amazing creatures up close and in a relatively natural habitat. We were really lucky as we were one of the last to leave and a young orangutang made its way over the enclosure to within a few feet so we got some really great photos. There is also a 5km trail walk through the jungle but we didn't have time to do it. Definitely worth a visit and right next door is the sun bear sanctuary. "

You can also spot them on the boardwalks. 2 of them walked in front of us as though leading us for almost 2 minutes!There is a forest trail which we missed but heard good reviews of.

We heard that orangutan may not make an appearance but we must have been very lucky because as we walked in we crossed paths with one having a leisurely stroll. The feeding platform received around 4 or 5 visitors and the juveniles in the nursery were hilarious to watch 
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 13 July 2016,Couples,"This a sanctuary where the orphaned or injured orangutans are cared for with the aim to release back into the wild. There are 2 feelings per day one in the morning and one in the afternoon. The animals are free to come and go so if you are unlucky like us they may not turn up to a feeding. But there are always some around in the trees so you do get to see them in their natural habitat even if they don't come to a feeding session which is great.You can sponsor some of the orphans which is worthwhile as this seems to be the only hope to try to keep this species alive on the planet, and nothing happens in this world without adequate funding.It is a well run facility with a great introductory talk given just before the 10am feeding and probably before the afternoon one as well.Pretty easy to get to if you are not on a tour, with a taxi costing around 100RM from Sandakan. It takes around 30mins to drive there from the city centre. There is a camera fee charged 10 RM, and if your lens is bigger than 450mm the charge is 1000RM."

We were lucky enough to encounter an orangutan walking along and this was the highlight of our day. It's unfortunate that they charge more for tourists than for locals. I wouldn't particularly recommend it, unless this is the only way you can get to see orangutans. "
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 11 July 2016,Solo,"Spent the whole day between here and the Sun Bear conservation center. The orangutans are ridiculously fascinating animals - I didn't want to leave at closing time! The beginning of the morning feeding was insanely packed (all of the tour buses get there first thing), but they all cleared out when the first set of orangutans were done eating and left the platform around 10:20. Patience is a virtue, y'all! About 5 minutes later, a mother and her crazy small baby (who was adorably clinging to her as she swung in on the ropes) came to the platform, and they were soon followed by two more orangutans. Only 6 or 7 of us were left to watch the baby snatching food from its mom's hands, which made the experience much more lax and wondrous. There were also drastically less people at the afternoon feeding, so it felt much less hectic and touristy then as well. I have to admit, it would have been nicer to be closer to them, but since this is a rehab center meant to aid the orangutans reintroduce themselves to wild life, it's best that tourists keep their distance. This doesn't always happen though - one of them swung onto the walkway and proceeded to walk with us for a minute before hopping back off into the forest!It was also quite wonderful to sit in the A/C and watch the young orangutans play on the jungle gym by the nursery. At one point there were around 8-10 of them swinging around, wrestling, and grabbing bananas from each other. Even though you are separated by glass, you are a bit closer to them here than by the feeding platform, so you can see their features much more clearly. Incredible experience!"
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 10 July 2016,Couples,"This trip was one of the highlights of our holiday in borneo. We flew in from Kota Kinabalu early morning and went straight to the orangutans. We were very fortunate too as we were the first people in that day and managed to see an orangutan on the walkway to the feeding areas. This allowed us some great photo time and it was all managed very safely by the excellent guides. During the morning feeding time we again were fortunate enough to see 5 orangutan and a lot of other monkeys, but the highlight for me was during the afternoon feeding when a couple of the cheekier orangutan came right over to us and were running round causing all sorts of mischief. All in all it was amazing but be aware as stated you are not gauranteed to see anything as it is a big reserve and we did hear people going and not seeing a great deal. My opinion is go and be open minded. Also be aware how humid it can be in the rain forest areas so if travelling by plane a fresh change of clothing is advisable"

Each time I have been there have been around 5 Orangutans turn up for some food. Bring a fan, it's usually oh so hot and humid. The new baby Orangutan enclosure is good, however you can't be guaranteed any little guys will visit as they are in the wild. We were lucky enough to see a couple on the walking track but don't interfere with these little guys they are still wild animals."

The Baby orangutan outside Gym did not disappoint and we managed to see 6 who put on a little show for us visitors.  the viewing was inside an A/C room which believe me was needed the humidity was so high outside.Feeding time at the platform the ranger managed to coax one male out of the surrounding area and we had a small show of his skills (playing) the staff were fantastic and were able to answer all questions and gave some great insight into this project.  I even adopted an orangutan as I wanted to help with saving these wonderful animalsHighly recommend a visit it was well worth the flight over from Sabah to Sepilok and the early start to make it for the 10am feeding.Fantastic work being done here

You can't guarantee to see Orang Utan but should be lucky and you will certainly find some in the outdoor nursery which is protected by glass. Watch the video before you go in to have scene set. Great ice lime to drink in cafe after.

We were staying in The Rasa Ria Resort in Kota Kinabalu so had to get a flight there and back which is no hassle really. So long as you have transfers to and from the airport pre arranged. It's a long day though so be prepared. And take plenty of mosquito repellent. They can be pretty relentless. The orang-utans  themselves are essentially wild so you can't predict if they are going to hang around or not. You could be lucky and see 30 or,like us only see 5, but that's ok. We saw the babies in the nursery area which is also completely uncaged and unrestricted. They are so playful and really quite naughty. Winding each other up and annoying the keeper who was desperately trying to get them into the good habit of staying off the Forrest floor. It's not good  for them to sit around on the floor apparently. These Orangutans have a fantastic life and it felt like how an animal centre should feel in my opinion.  But my big point here is, yes the orang-utans are awesome and you can't go to Sepilok without seeing them but please go and see the Sunbears as well! They for me were the unsung Heroes of our visit. and lending your support won't hurt! Its not like it's ""break the bank"" expensive. And if you catch them at feeding time you can see them really close up and they are really cute. As always if you have any more direct questions let me knowüòé"
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 5 July 2016,Family,"We flew early yesterday morning to sandakan from Kota Kinabalu and took a short taxi ride to the sanctuary. Once we got inside, we walked through to the outside nursery along the raised walkways looking at the wildlife until we reached the buildings. We sat for about 20 minutes watching the young Orangs learning through play. After that we got to the feeding platform around 30minutes before feeding time. It was a clear day so pretty hot and sweaty but hey, this is Borneo after all. We saw one orangutan make its way to the feeding platform and tuck into its food, followed by some cheeky macaques that stole some food. After everyone left the feeding platform viewing area we hung around for a bit and saw another smaller orang come out to eat and swing around. This in itself was great but as we were having a walk around an orangutan made his way over to the walkway and walked along side us for a good 10 minutes. Close enough to touch (no touching allowed for good reason) this was simply breathtaking. These animals can come and go as they please without boundaries which is great to know. We were able to photograph them and just watch in awe. After that close encounter the sanctuary closes from 11am til 2pm. At 2pm we went back in to watch more of the same and were rewarded with another close encounter. On the walkways we were lucky enough to see and photograph two pit vipers and also a giant hornbill and some other cool critters. I'm aware that sometimes the orangutans may not be seen at all which would be disappointing but it's still worth taking a chance and its supporting a very worthwhile cause. The volunteers at sepilok do an amazing job to help these endangered animals and have helped to release numerous orangutans "

You want to ensure you are there in the morning or afternoon for feeding time for an opportunity to see the wildlife. The sanctuary is well set up with no fencing to keep the animals in, but providing food supplements for Orangutans brought to the area until they are ready to fend for themselves. Our visit we had the opportunity to see one adult. The Sanctuary has a nursery which is where we got the greatest show.

If you plan on doing this then try and arrange your taxi to come back after your visit as we had to wait some time after. The centre does not allow any bags to be brought into their grounds but they provide lockers for free. They have large and small lockers so if you're doing a one day trip and have your luggage there won't be a problem to store it here. We had a little walk around before the scheduled feeding time, there were no orangutans to be seen and after around 15mins of waiting we saw our first orangutan come in from the wild. Once it left we patiently waited as others decided to move on and we got to see another come in. The baby orangutans were very sweet but were behind glass so it had more of a zoo feeling, but we stayed until they closed the nursery and managed to see the more curious babies from outside as they came around the building to take a look at us. Upon leaving the centre one orangutan decided to sit up on the roof of one of the buildings which was our closest encounter of the day. They are doing good work here and had a great visit. You can definitely do this within the day and get back to the airport (just make sure you have arranged your taxi to get you back). "

There are also so many other things to do including trails!1)My advice would be to go the afternoon feedings. This place is completely different in the afternoon with a much more peaceful feeling and almost deserted feeling. The am feeding team is heaving With big tourist groups. There was more orangutans in the afternoon and comparing to the morning one were in the surrounding area. We watched for half s hour beforehand a mother and baby in the trees!2)Also take walking boots and do a trail before the afternoon feeding session. Beautiful rainforest walk and lovely tall bird spotting stations.3) the cafe next is also very reasonable in terms of price and food!4) don't even think of doing it with a tourist group! They spend 1-2 hours here maximum and not the true benefit. Fly in very early and stay in sepilok itself which is on the same road to the sanctuary!Worth the visit!

It costs more if you're a 'foreigner' about three times as much (30RM) you also have to pay 10RM for a camera. The ticket lasts all day.When you get in they suggest you walk all the way through first, you'll go past the feeding area, then to the activity centre for the young orang-utans which is super, you look at them on the training equipment learning how to survive, it's very cute.The morning feed is very busy, it's when all the tours arrive so there's a good 80 people there. We saw two orang-utans in the morning, which was nice. But it did get better! after the morning feed I went on the trail, make sure you have lots of water (buy from the cafeteria) and spray with insect repellant. The total return length is around 6k. I went to the second station and came back, you probably don't need to do much further. It's a good trail, where decent shoes as it can be a little wet. It's hot and humid in there, it's brilliant to walk in the rainforest, the trees are huge, there's a few signs with the birds you can see (although I didn't see any). You don't need to be especially fit to do the trail but some of the steps are quite large, wouldn't be good for very small children and not for carrying babies. It's worth doing. The start of the trail closes at 2pm to allow you to get back before the centre closes at 5pm.On the way back we were incredibly lucky to see an orang-utan up close. He literally dropped down from the tree, started pulling at my scarf and stole my water bottle. Glad he was a young one as he was very strong. Nothing to be scared off but they do say not to touch them but it was hard when he kept grabbing at us! We had a wonderful 10 minutes interaction with him, was a very memorable experience.The afternoon feed was better than the morning. There were only about 15 people watching. We saw four orang-utans and a host of cheeky macaques who did everything they could to steal the food, very entertaining to watch! The orang-utans were having none of it and kept swiping at them. Each feed lasts about 30 minutes.The small gift shop is nice, there's a number of nice gifts to buy. The cafeteria seemed fine, quite large, Food and drink and cigarettes amongst other things for sale.If possible I would do this as one day rather than just coming with the tour.

Combine this with plenty of fruit in the jungle at the time of year we were there and this explains why there were only 2 at the feeding we went to. Very cute!! The family of monkeys that came after were very entertaining though.

We tried to watch a video just after  but we were told we had to wait until 2 for the next viewing even though noone was around! Bizarre! To not give people the information we are here for, to find out about the causes and solutions to wildlife vs human consumption is outrageous! Big shame that we were stopped from educating ourselves and a big shame that nowhere were the words ""OIL PLANTATIONS"" uttered.Also ironic that the cafe sells lots of nestle products. Prime opportunity here to educate people into making responsible decisions but failed by offering us kit kats etc which are renowned for using unsustainable palm oil,  probably from these very plantations!Big fail when there's such a valuable opportunity here, but of course seeing these orangutans is priceless  :("

The centre is well organised, with an information centre and a video room informing you on how and why the centre was set up.  The entrance fee is MR 70 for 2 people and includes a MR10 for use of your camera.  They feed the orangutans twice a day, 10am and 3pm.  I think they do this to guarantee that you will see the orangs up close.  However, we did one of the jungle trails, and had a more personal experience,  we spent probably an hour just watching the orangutans swinging really up close, it was quite a magical experience!  There is an enclosed nursery where you observe the young orangutans.  Overall a great day out."

Unfortunately I went on a very heavily visited day, where there was a lot of noise from the visitors.  Unfortunately the noise scares the Orangutan away.  I did end up getting to see a few playing around in the training center, where they are trying to teach young Orangutan to climb and live in the trees (since most come to the sanctuary after having been pets and they never learned how to be a proper Orangutan and survive in the wild).I was also able to see an older Orangutan making a nest in the wild, and testing it out to make sure it was strong enough to hold him during his nap.  I hired a guide to take me through here, and it was totally worth it.  He spotted many of the things that I ended up seeing, and he also had connections at the sanctuary that allowed me to move around outside of the crowds of people.  It was clear that he loved the ""man of the forest"" as much as any of the visitors.I assume that most people who go to Sandakan are probably already planning to go here, but I can say it was totally worth the trip.

Clearly I can sit here and tell you how amazing the Orang Utan's are, but you probably already know that. The important thing to note with Sepilok is that the animals are treated with dignity, love and the respect they deserve as the Kings and queens of the Bornean Forests. They're not an attraction, they're not forced to perform; in fact they're not forced to do anything. They come and go as they please and that is enough to make Sepilok perfect. The staff are brilliant; friendly and informative, the prices are reasonable... It truly is a fantastic place. "

She obviously wasn't really interested in the bananas on offer!  This did not upset us as we know the sanctuary is working if the rescued animals don't rely on the feeding times. Instead we looked for birds & saw a beautiful yellow & green pit viper coiled in a tree near the walkway. The local families with children were very noisy at the platform (one child even wore shoes that squeaked every time she put her foot down!) & this was very off putting to me let alone the wildlife. The outdoor nursery was delight - we could sit in air conditioned comfort & watch the younger Orang Utans frolicking outside & the interaction between them & the cheeky macaque monkeys was fun to watch. Well worth a visit to learn of the work being done by volunteers to rehabilitate  these magnificent creatures.

There're just too many people during feeding time and they're hard to keep quiet.  There was only one orang utan this time and he looked like he'd rather be elsewhere if not for the bananas.  However, from the walkways around the sanctuary you may be able to spot a few guys (or gals) high up some trees.  Make sure you bring binoculars (or rent them at the site).  Another alternative is to go to the nursery (also during feeding time).  You can sit on benches in an air conditioned room behind large windows and watch the little ones swing down or along ropes to the ""dining"" platform for a bit of grub brought in by volunteers.  There were about half a dozen when I was there although they didn't all come at the same time.

We were with a guide who told us lots about the place and how it came in to being. The nursery area is behind glass so feels more like a zoo but it is still lovely to watch them messing about. The feeding platforms are great and we spotted about 10 different orangutans during both of our two visits. They are remarkable creatures and a pleasure to see them in an almost wild habitat.

Once rehabilitated, not all orangutans come back to this centre as it has no fences for the apes. We were lucky enough to see a number of them throughout the site including a baby clinging to its mother. The feeding times are very busy with tourists and the best encounters are on the walkways between the outdoor nursery and the feeding point. Keep your eyes peeled and you may come across one right in front of you. If you wait a while after the tourists leave the feelings, you may also get some private encounters. There are trails going out into the jungle but it is slow going and as you cannot take water into the centre during the feeding times, it would be unwise to venture far into the jungle. We walked the 1.4km in flip flops to the bird watch tower and the 1.4km back. Long trousers and proper boots or shoes would be better if you venture further. I think you are able to go out of the centre to pickup your bags and water to do the trails as the feeding section is closed off from around 11.30am- 2.30pm. When you arrive there are free lockers where you must put bags, sun cream, bug sort and water etc as they cannot be taken into the centre for the feeding. There is a cafe outside where you can go for a cheap lunch and cold drinks. It also does ice cream and is air conditioned. The photo is an infant encountered above a walkway near the nursery.

The return flight cost about ¬£30 with Asia airlines and takes around 35 minutes. We had also booked a driver for the day for a fixed price. We got to the rehabilitation centre with about half hour to kill before it opened at 9:00 am. There are lockers of various sizes to store your items as your not allowed to take in bottled water, repellents etc etc in case they are grabbed by either the Orangutang's or the macaques. There is a small fee payable if your using cameras of any sort. Someone was even charged for their smart phone while other people put their small cameras in their pockets and so wasn't charged. The fee is something like ¬£2 for a camera but it goes towards rehabilitation of the Orangutang's so it's worth paying. Once the tour starts your entrance and camera tickets are checked then your led along a wooden walkway through the to the nursery feeding station. Your inside a building with large glass windows and the animals are outside but are free to come and go as they please so your not guaranteed to see any. Food was put out at about and they was called then you just sit and wait. It must have been a good ten to fifteen minutes before we seen our first young Orangutan. We then saw a small Macaque come in and steal some food. Time was getting on as feeding time at the other station was at 10:00am and it's a five minute walk away. We decided to leave the nursery feeding station and as we was walking along the walkway back to the main feeding area there was a young Orangutang walking along the handrail without a care in the world. We stood back and let him past within a metre of where we was standing. At the main feeding station there are two viewing platforms to observe the feeding Orangutans  a small one to the left and the main one in front. Again your not guaranteed to see any or all of them. We managed to see two Orangutan's at that feeding station. There are also nature walks to do on the reserve anything from 250 metres up to 5km. We started the walk to see some of the local birds we even managed to see a pigmy elephant and Trainer, but after about 1km of climbing over tree roots and steep climbs in places and no water in this very humid jungle we decided to turn back.

We met one of the volunteers there who gave us so much information. These guys deserve so much credit for what they do. It's an incredible day and seeing them in a natural environment is so reassuring. I would recommend this to anyone. "

You have the option of staying at several Rain Forest 3 star resorts nearby. We did & enjoyed the experience . This is a re-abilitation  centre, the Orang Utan's are raised hear & are free to roam the massive reserve. We visited for both feeding sessions morning about 9am & afternoon. There is an entry fee plus a 10 ringet charge per camera. Remember whilst a Sanctuary the Orang Utan roam free. We were lucky to see a lot more in the afternoon than the morning feeding session. Offers we spoke to only had seen 2."

They appeared out of the jungle. You could also hear them moving from tree to tree.These guys peel bananas like us, eat fruit off the skin and dispose of the skin, have hands like us, wipe their mouths, the young ones watch the older ones to learn and try, they break open coconuts llke we do banging them against a hard object. One just needs to watch them to see some of behavioural moments and one can see us in some way. This lasted for about an hour and your camera does not stop clicking.This first session lasted for over an hour.The afternoon session started at the nursery where the younger ones can be viewed from behind a glass wall so they are not infected by human germs. Even the staff wear overalls, boots and masks.This again was an amazing experience as we had 2 in the tress playing around, one sitting on the fence and enjoying us, 2 younger ones being naughty. The feed session only 1 appeared but it was not there in the morning. It acted quite differently. Un beknown to us (until we expanded the downloaded photo she had a young against her body and was breast feeding it whilst doing the normal things with the food.This was truly an amazing experience but maybe we were fortunate that nature and the orangutans  appeared.Also the caf√© is great and does not overcharge for food & drinks like many other places around the world do."

Sepilok Orangutan Sanctuary does an amazing job at what they are supposed to, which is saving and training orphaned orangutans. But as a place to visit, it is not very special. The tourist-organutan ratio seemed to be 100:1. It is more fascinating to watch people's monkey-like behaviour with their cameraphones than the poor organgutans trying to eat."
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 12 May 2016,,"We were staying in Sandakan and took the 9am number 14 bus from the second bus station, keep walking past the main station and cross the road, it's next to a small market. The bus gets you to the sanctuary just before the first feeding.Watching the orangutans arrive at the feeding station is amazing, the young ones like to do cartwheels along the wires and are generally very playful. Keep a look out for shaking wires which signify an organutan is coming. After the first feeding I would head over to the indoor viewing area where you can see the smaller orangutans feed and play on the outdoor equipment. Once you've taken this in head over to the jungle walk. Bare in mind there is a good chance you will see orangutans close up on the walk (one was on the path when we went). Some animals can be very curious and love to steal cameras. Try to remember that these are critically rare animals which are also trying to be rehabilitated into the wild and so show them as much respect as possible. The park itself is amazing, it gives the orangutans the opportunity to come back and be fed twice a day on their own terms. Some of them come back and some remain out in the jungle. Head over to the sun bear sanctuary after this and check these animals out, these are more rare than the orangutans and don't get as much attention and public support. After that you can watch the final feeding session at 3pm and then catch the last bus back to Sandakan at 4pm. "
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 12 May 2016,Couples,"An incredible and exciting experience. Came to Borneo for this very reason..to see these amazing animals. The guide mentioned (as did the tour operator) that viewings are not guaranteed and a group that went just a few days ago saw none.. You need to appreciate its not a zoo.. It's a nature reserve.. 46 sq km of rainforest and they will show up when they want to, not on demand. Anyone been on a wold safari will understand that.We were lucky enough to also get access to the nursery where they have a few young ones in at the momentFollowing that, we saw 4 at feeding time and then a few more along the walk ways. To end with a bang.. We had one hanging out near the entrance who was very comfortable with a few of us being quite close (with supervision of park rangers).  Have attached a few pics from my cam of our encounter.  (Just got back to our hotel from there)"

We were able to see them during the morning feeding time and also afternoon. Morning is very busy with tourists, but in the afternoon, we were able to have a closer look at the orangutans, and also we saw a few wondering around the trails.  The rangers are all over, you are not allow to touch the apes, but they come very closet to us and I was able to get some pics with them. No water or food is allowed into the center, but they have lockers where you can leave your bags.  Do not miss the short movie playing every hour. "

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 11 May 2016,,"Please remember that the Organutan is almost 97% the same as humans! To see these creatures in their own environment is very special.  They are thriving and its all down to the centres hard work and dedicate.  The centre shows off amazing rainforest and lots of other wild animals if you're lucky enough to spot it.  We caught site of a female Organutan who had a tiny baby holding on to her - apparently only a week old!  The visit can get busy, however, you are free to move from the feed platforms to the walking trail and nursery area at your own speed.  The centre really tries to educate everyone that visits; its delicated handle and I think is the perfect balance of information for everyone to digest.  Understanding why you cannot take your bag into the forest is also crucial; I hope everything respects this and facilities to store your bags are provided.  If you book the trip as a tour, your guide will usually lock your bags in the car you travelled there in.  Either way, everything is safe and for a fee of 10RM you can take your camera in (phones are free).  It's well worth paying the fee if you have a camera as you can really zoom in close and get some incredible pictures.  Most of all the costs all go towards running the centre and educating more people."

The staff do a great job, lots of information, the walkways are easy to manage (AND we had the bonus of an OrangUtan loping along with us). The different areas are excellent for watching these beautiful animals. One area was behind glass (for the orphans) and the other, a feeding station. Promptly at ten, the keeper arrived with his basket of goodies and within a minute the first OranUtan arrived. Soon after, a mother and baby. It was such a thrill, even watching the cheeky monkey stealing the food when the OranUtans weren't looking!  After this we visited the Sun Bear Sanctuary, equally as good."

Kudos to the team for creating a lovely visitor experience without negatively impacting on the adorable orangutans themselves.  Your visit begins with an interesting slide show, explaining the history of the sanctuary. Of course, it's down to luck as to what you'll see when you go to observe the feeding, but we were super lucky and saw a number of orangutans. In fact, we were compelled by the pleadings of our 10 year old to adopt one for a year!  We went on to see orangutans in the wild at Kinabatangan and Danum Valley, but that didn't lessen our experience here where we all learnt about the plight and future for these unique creatures."

We actually went twice and while it looks like there will always be orangs there at feeding time - there is no guarantee.  We were glad we visited the platform twice.  The all day ticket let us leave and come back
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 7 May 2016,Friends,We enjoyed seeing Orang-Utans here. Nice walks through the forest and I'm sure they doing a lot for the animals. Still my impression was that it is more a good business and that you get more out of it spotting the animals while you are walking through the jungle with a tour. 
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 6 May 2016,Family,Worth to visit. There is no better way to see Orang Utan in their natural surrounding. But it is of course not like seeing them in real wilderness 
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 4 May 2016,Family,Not many Orangutans at the sight which is probably good because they are not supposed to wait for feeding as this sanctuary is aim to send these animals back into the forest. The nursery is good and fun for kids.However some administrators there are not very friendly. All hand carried bags are to be kept in lockers but not told in advance and the lady looking after the lockers is not very polite. Lucky the place is not far apart to make us walk in a round about.
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 4 May 2016,Family,"The Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Center is an amazing, must-see opportunity.  We went 4 times in 2 days, for the 11am and 3pm daily feedings.  The center has a baby orangutan area (behind glass) where we observed recently rescued individuals, and open raised walkways through the rainforest where we observed adults, who come to the main platform to eat bananas and drink milk.  At each feeding we saw many orangutans who sometimes ventured onto the observation platform and walkways, right next to us.  The weather was oppressively hot and humid, and lasting the entire hour on the observation platform is challenging.  However, seeing the orangutans freely roaming in their native habitat was worth it!  (There are no fences in the sanctuary).  Try to attend the afternoon feedings since the mornings are often crowded by tour bus crowds.  Highly recommended!"
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 3 May 2016,Couples,On walk through to viewing platform saw some orangutans close to and got good photos. At viewing station very good view of little ones including our adoptee.  Good information given on individual orangutans by enthusiastic guide.  At feeding station it was quite crowded and difficult to see older ones but overall a lovely experience and oils highly recommend. 
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 3 May 2016,Family,The park is a nice getaway. especially when taken into consideration that a meeting with orang utan in the wild is not very promising. The orang utan sanctiary is a good alternative or warm up. Make sure you're there when the monkeys are fed.In the park are also a few nice hikes.
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 3 May 2016,Couples,The work they do here is exceptional and I expect they need visitors to contine to fund the great work.  You get the opportunity to see them playing and at the feeding stations. We saw many Orangatangs of various ages including a mother and baby & a Macaque monkey. I would recommend this visit to anyone interested in the conservative of these wonderful creatures.
3.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 2 May 2016,Couples,"Nice place to have a guaranteed view at orang utans in their semi-natural environment. If you didn't find them in the wild, this would be a decent plan B.After visiting the baby orang utan center and viewing the adults at their feeding platform, you can do a short one way 1.1km walk in the rainforest. Unfortunately we didn't get to see any birds on this so call 'bird trail' (we did hear them), but the scenery is nice and we did run into a couple of squirrels and butterflies.Tip: You can store your luggage (including large suitcases) in the spacious locker boxes for free."

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 1 May 2016,Couples,"Admittedly, orangutans are one of our favorite animals.  But this place really is special.  They are doing incredible work to rehabilitate and care for orangutans, and make visiting (for humans) a great experience.  Although we had a guide from our nearby hotel (Sepilok Nature Resort), guides are not required.  Do visit the nursery - although it is glassed off from you, the viewing room has an air conditioned section and seeing the younger orangutans learning to swing, play, etc. is priceless.  Morning and afternoon feedings are different - afternoon feedings are quieter with less crowds.  Although they say to arrive 30 minutes before the feedings, you really don't need to - it is at most a 5 min. walk from the gate to the feeding platform.   "

It is a little theme parkish but having said that they seem to have taken as many steps possible to keep the orangutans away from humans (juveniles are behind glass) as best as possible but in addition the ""Big boy"" that came up close and personal for a photo shoot seemed to know he was posing for pictures.

We were met a driven to the site and taken on the trip through the park...many interesting varieties of flora and fauna and then the orangutans come to the feeding sites and interact with the guests, some are quite humerous and mess with you.

Or grand plan was to get up early and spend the day with the orang-utans and the sun bears. There are two viewing times for the orang-utans 10:00 and 15:00. Outside of these times the park is closed however the sun bear enclosure is open all day.We did the morning feed, grabbed some lunch at 'lindung cafe and gallery' (which was superb) had a snappy nap and then went to the sun bears before the afternoon feed.I really wasn't sure what to expect from the sanctuary, but I came out of the park with a new found respect for the organisation running the program and a heart felt desire to do something to help this amazing species.The orang-utans are simply beautiful. We were fortunate enough to  see them twice at both platforms in addition to an impromptu leap to the walkway as we finished the bird watching walk!You cannot help but smile as they swing from tree to tree and interact with one another. My wife and I were just wrapped with the experience:The sun bears were also wonderful, it is a rather small exhibit but the walkway through the tree tops provides an excellent vantage point for photos and general viewing. Can't recommend this experience enough!Entrance fees were approx 30MYR per person."

Unsurprisingly the number of visitors here not only from our ship, but also her sister, Silver Whisper, and many other tour groups were very large.There was a long trek along a substantial wooden boardwalk, to a covered viewing platform. From here we were able to view the provision of food that the orangutans were at liberty to collect. During our visit there were just two of the great apes who came to eat, and then performed acrobatic moves up and down the ropes and jumping from tree to tree.We departed through the shop and the Orangutans adoption opportunity. The latter quite expensive, however the fridge magnets and ephemera were realistically priced.Although enjoyable, we felt the visit was rushed, and we would like to have stayed longer, hence our disappointment, with no time to see the orphaned animals. Passengers only doing this trip, did spend longer here, but we had to drive some distance to reach the proboscis monkeys' reserve."

We arrives before opening time and spent the whole day at the centre , with plenty of time to spend in the nursery and also visiting the Sun Bear centre which attaches to this one ( additional cost) but well worth it as we saw more urangutan within arms reach here.

Lunch was included but at an Halal restaurant which was uninspiring. Later we had 'tea' at a delightful house above the town.

We caught the 14 Sepliok bus which left at 9am from Sandakan, and took about 30 minutes.You firstly need to lock away all your bags and drinks etc, and are recommended to only take your camera's in. You need to pay an extra 10myr on top of your admission (30myr - foreign adult), but the lockers are free. Its not guarenteed how many Orang Utans will come as they are wild but we got to see two at the feeding area which lasted about 30mins, and another three along the trail which leads to a bird area...which was rather disappointing as there were no birds around, but the scenary along the trail was nice. The trail is up to 5km long if you have the energy, but we only did 1.5km. FYI - They have bottles of water at the checkpoint before entering the trail - take one if you want to go the distance. Unfortunately we only found out when coming back as they are not on display for obvious reasons....monkeys will steel them!Make sure you get to the Nursery after the feed though as you'll then catch the young Orang Utans being feed too. Its great to see them playing in the nursery there, they are very cute and the staff look after them very well. This is definitely a must do if in the Sandakan / Sepilok area. "

This is not the case, the work this rehab centre carries out is paramount to preserving the life of these wonderful creatures. The Orang's are wild and you have to be prepared that you may not get to see one, this should be a plus point not a negative. This was our first stop on our Borneo adventure and after we visited here we went and stayed deep in the rainforest, where we saw in excess of 8 wild Orang's.The work that the rehab carries out must be so rewarding, the stress that the poor babies have been through is heart breaking. It is amazing to see such dedication from the staff and their knowledge of the jungle men is fantastic. It is set up for tourists and it does get crowded but you need to look past all that and see the wonderful work that is being carried out."

The nursery area is a welcome edition which wasn't there for my previous visit. You can see the youngsters practicing their climbing skills and being cared for by the staff. The viewing area is large and has multiple levels so everyone can get a good view. The centre workers normally hide behind the large tree trunk whilst feeding the juveniles so they don't appear in visitor photos.  The introductory video could probably do with an update as it is now 10 years old.  From here it is also very easy to visit the nearby sun bear rescue centre too.

Do not expect them to come close to you. My children expected that and were a little dissapointed at first but we were able to explain that that is not natural. We also went to see the little monkeys at the nursery. You can only observe them behind glass, a bit like in a zoo. Next to that we also took the walk in the area which as nice. When you are lucky you can see some special birds. At the entrance is also a little restaurant with reasonable food against very reasonable prices. You can visit the feeding platform 2 a day.

We were there for the afternoon feeding and no orangutan showed up (this is a good things as it means they are providing food for themselves) so we missed that part. If you really want to see the feeding I suggest you allow for the chances to have to come back a second time ( they feed twice a day morning and afternoon). We were very happy just with seeing them play

They are doing a fantastic job rehabilitating them and putting them back where they belong.When I was there it poured down rain but there was some cover to hide under until the rain stopped. It didn't bother the orangs though and we saw about 10 different individuals. The main crowd shuffled off quite early and I hung around for a bit. I am glad I did as a couple of young ones came over to the guest area and got within 2 metres of my camera. Grey macaques and a couple of Giant Squirrels (Provost's Squirrels?) also headed to the eating platform after the Orangs had had their feed. This all happened between the hours of 10 and 11:30 in the morning. The Sun Bear sanctuary is just across the road.

We did not hire a guide nor is there any need to.- Got there in the morning at the first feeding time. Saw just a couple of Orangutans come by to relish the free food :)- At the first feeding platform, we also got to see a snake and a mouse deer.- We walked to the second feeding platform which is an enclosed AC pavilion where you can see the nursery animals. This is lot like being at a zoo but nonetheless you get to appreciate the work they are doing.- We then took to the many trails in the rainforest. We really enjoyed this walk among giant trees and vines- We returned, had lunch at the cafeteria and then returned back in time for the second feeding. A whole bunch of Orangutans showed up this time including a wild one and a mother with a baby (who did not like that wild Orangutan, BTW).

Altogether well worth the visit, part of our trip a deal tour. We also had  buffet lunch there round the lake later on our tour."

It is nice to see how Malaysian people take good care of these lovely animals, which are so similar to humans. The centre itself is really a good example of preservation and help for animals. I was scared this would look like a zoo but it is not and i did like to see how naturally the animals go around. They are totally free and seem to be enjoying their stay. If you have kids it is really a must to stop here. You are sure you see the orangutan and from pretty close! "

Some nice area for the young ones to denvelops their climbing and slinging skills.Too Bad we only got to see the Orang utangs when it was feeding Time and not 'in the wild'.Also, i think it's ridiculous you have to pay extra to Bring a camera with you..

There was only 1 orangutan showed up for our 10am feed with huge crowd from all the tour groups.

When bringing a 'camera' into the park you must pay a total of 40 MR for your entree ticket.I highly advise going to the sanctuary whenever the feeding times take place which, I believe is at 10:00 andat 15:00. The reason for this is that this will be the time in which you will see the orangutans, with a fair chance of not seeing any when going outside of these times, as it is an open sanctuary, rather than a zoo.The outdoor sanctuary where the younger orangutans come to eat is extremely entertaining and enjoyable for guests of all ages."

They have a clear passion not only for the Orangutans they care for but also in their role in educating tourists in the messages of conservation. The park was very professionally run. We went in with a guide, however the centre also position rangers around the walkways for safety and didn't allow you to take in items that the orangs would like to pinch. Especially as some of these may cause them harm.Please don't go expecting to see these wonderful creatures just feel blessed if they do choose to visit the feeding platforms while you're there. The Macaques will be ready and waiting for any food that's going begging. X2 feeding platforms now. The outdoor nursery, open at 9am is viewed by an air conditioned room through 1 way glass. The adult forest feeding platform remains open at 10am.PS 10 ringgit charge for taking your camera in, but this does go straight back to fund the centre's work."
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 14 April 2016,Family,The Sepilok Orang-utan Rehabilitation Centre is a Malaysian government-backed initiative to safeguard the well-being of orphaned orang-utans.  The public area is largely a walkway around the forest including a viewing area of a feeding platform and another viewing area for younger orang-utan's climbing training.  Additionally there is a trail which leads off somewhere into the thicker forest.  The walkway is flat so is accessible if potentially bumpy.Saving the orang-utan is a worthy endeavour and a great thing to support.  Entry fee for a couple of adults and a couple of children aged 2+ is 100 MYR which isn't the cheapest.  The entry ticket entitles the visitor to walk around the walkway all day except for lunchtime when it is closed for a couple of hours.Outside food and drink is banned so a free locker is provided for backpacks.  That can be a bit frustrating as waiting at a feeding station in the humidity with no water is a challenge.Many visitors seem to come in the morning but those who do can miss out.  It was the afternoon that had much more orang-utan action.  The feeding station was empty in the morning of a visit but returning in the afternoon saw orang-utans and monkeys.  The afternoon session also included an orang-utan strolling along the guardrail of the walkway right next to passers-by as well as some orang-utans and monkeys in the trees nearby.The guarantee of seeing orang-utans is the climbing training.  A handful of smaller orang-utans are there to practice clambering around.  They have their own feeding platforms and plenty of places to play.  It is just as much fun watching the keepers try to chase the orang-utans off the ground and back onto the equipment.The centre is not huge so can be walked at a good pace fairly quickly.  This could be a disappointment but for smaller people it is still a good walk in the forest.As well as the main centre there is a second building which approximates a museum.  One section contains a large screen for viewing a documentary about the rehabilitation centre.  The documentary is nice but not that enthralling especially for those who have seen several such documentaries and reality shows.  The museum area contains a record of the work of the centre but it seems to have been put up in the late 1990s and so is somewhat out of date.For those who want to support orang-utans this sanctuary is a great place.  The risk for a visitor is only seeing them in their training centre which is a bit like a zoo experience.  Best to go for both morning and afternoon to maximise the chances.
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 13 April 2016,Family,"We stayed locally at the Sepilok Jungle Resort for 3 nights in total and went to the Sanctuary 3 times in the afternoon where we had a fantastic experience each time.There are two feeding times a day, once in the morning at 10am and the other in the afternoon at 3pm. Apparently the morning ones are quite busy however we found the afternoon ones quite relaxed without too many people. There is a video and exhibition area as well. You can't take bags into the sanctuary however there are lockers where you can leave them when you go in.Each time we went we saw Orangutans - in the nursery areas we saw a lot of the younger ones and also a mother and her baby which was so cute and quite amazing. She came in from the wider forest and then settled into the feeding area. The nursery is behind glass but very well organised and it's easy to see the animals. We felt it was much more relaxed than a zoo and you could get to know the personalities of the animals and see that they were definitely coming in from the forest further away. We also saw orangutans from the walk way. One rushed off and started to build himself a nest to hide from us which was quite funny. He was literally arms lengths away. The other was sitting watching people pass as the sanctuary closed for evening. Unfortunately some of the tourists were complaining they couldn't touch him (again, he was really near to us) and didn't seem to understand about transmitting diseases. I think this could be better explained to people so that they don't upset the animals.We found that walking around was much more likely to see the Orangutans than at the feeding platform although we did see them there too along with Macaques.If you can spend longer in Sepilok than a quick see and go then I would recommend it. We felt like we got to know the area and the work being done better as well as the animals. Absolutely incredible to see them so free and easy - one even walked into the rangers area and we got close up to see him there too. Well worth a visit and well kept too."

2.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 12 April 2016,Family,"The workers at Sepilok do an amazing and, I'm certain, a most rewarding job rehabilitating these wondrous creatures, but I am not sure whether it is worth travelling thousands of miles across the world to visit.After a most interesting introductory talk from one of the workers about the place and the work they do, we were advised not to take anything in with us that might attract attention from the orangutangs - bags, food, sun glasses, hats etc. and certainly not to try to touch any of them and so we set off along a board walk through the forest expecting to catch a glimpse of one. No chance, so we were all positioned near a feeding area and waited and waited until one disinterested orangutang finally appeared with its keeper and messed around with some of the food for a few minutes. The highlight of this stop was the sight of a black squirrel running around. We were then ushered along the boardwalk into an air conditioned glass fronted auditorium and waited patiently until 3 small oranutangs appeared, played around for a couple of minutes and were then moved off by their minders. More keepers than orangutangs!! We waited again hoping to catch sight of more orangutangs, but were then asked to leave the building as they wanted to close it up. That was it, with regards to this visit. Expectations raised by all the pre-visit warnings and rewarded by just a few brief glimpses of orangutangs. I fully understand that these are wild animals and don't appear at the sound of a whistle, but with all the build up and warnings about the probability of encountering one whilst walking around the site, did raise expectations, but didn't really deliver much.Summing up, they do a fantastic job at this centre, but I can't say it is really worth a visit with the expectation of seeing these animals, you might not even see one."

An informative video is shown first and then you go to the feeding platform to watch orangutans come to eat. There's no guarantee they will come as they roam freely in the park (which is huge).  There is an indoor viewing area where you can watch the young orangutans playing outside and there are wooden walkways through the forest.  The orangutans are in the trees around you as you walk and can come close if they wish although it's advised by the Rangers that you don't let them get too close in case they steal your hats or glasses.

If you buy an entrance ticket in the morning you can use it again in the afternoon.There's an additional charge for use of cameras at 10 ringgit but it all goes towards the upkeep of the centre.You cannot take in bags, drinks or food - lockers are provided. There are feeding stations where you can get excellent views of the orang-utans and as they roam freely it's not unusual to see them walking along the walk way or climbing above you.You are best advised not to approach them as they can get quite aggressive and on our visit we did witness one tourist that found himself with one on his back, trying to peel down his shorts!If like me you're into photography, make the most of your time there and visit as many times as you can.

We saw plenty of Orangutans through the glass in the nursery area (it did feel just like a zoo though) but none when outside at the main platform unfortunately for us. However, our guide did advise that the rangers are happy when this happens as it means the Orangutans are coping well and not relying on the on them too much. We were lucky to see 3 pairs of Orangutans in the wild later near Gomantong Caves. So do be aware that viewing at feeding time is not guaranteed."

Which is excellent. But THEN you get shown a dvd that is 10 years old and therefore has incorrect and out of date information... However, the rehab center prides themselves on being a great education resource for tourists.... Furthermore, there was NO INFORMATION on the rate of orangatangs that actually survive once released into the wild Borneo jungle... I asked 6 different staff, NOT one could give me any information on these statistics. Not could they provide me with a website to look for this information.. for a place that openly displays how many tourist awards it has received, I was very disappointed to not receive up to date information on the progression of their rehab program..... Also, if you get frustrated with selfish ignorant people who want nothing more than a 'picture of a monkey', don't go here... "

Inform your self when there is feeding time for the monkeys or you won¬¥t see any ape. And be there early because the viewing platforms are small and many tourists come here to take pictures. During feeding time you will some monkeys even small babies. When you are done with seeing this take a stroll through the jungle path they made. Also very nice.

Now, it turns out to be more 'specifically' for Orang Utan, and you won't see any other animal like last time (except for Sun Bear, which also in different area, separate entrance fee). Last time i felt the Center is huge, more variety of flora and fauna, the forest area also gets smaller compare to last time which they had more hiking area to be explored, but now it does changed a lot. Entry also very specific time i guess if you not touring by tourist agent, there have only 9/8am and 2/3pm opening hours for feeding time the Orang Utan which that is the only opening time for the Centre. The rest of the time is closed. Inside, they have a glass wall viewing for orang utan feeding and air-conditioning hall, comfortable i must say but i prefer the old style which is open area and more closer to orang utan and to the nature. Not my preference."

My only complaint is that is says SILENCE when entering the feeding area - these creatures are being rehabilitated to return to the wild but a lot of tourists do not understand how to be silent or even quiet. They treated it as a zoo. I would like to see the centre personnel be a little more pro-active in ensuring they tourists respect the place a bit more and keep quieter and their children being  a bit more respectful.

Ours was at 10.30 in the morning but there is another feeding session in the afternoon! We only saw about 5 orangutangs at the first feeding platform as some are now self-sufficient and do not have to rely on keepers for their food. We saw a few more in the nursery area which was great! This place is suitable for anyone who loves animals and you do not have to walk far at all so also OK if you are not a great trekker! We also saw the sun bears at the same site but again, not far to walk at all!

We took a bus from Sipadan (i think every number higher than 14 goes to the turn- off to the center), paid 5 ringgits. From the turn-off there are cars, some sort of taxis that bring you to the center for another 5 ringgits for 2 people. Entrance fee is 30 ringgits. The feeding time starts at 10 am and it is not a show...as one might expect. Sometimes orangutans dont show up at all and it is a good sign! It means that they find enough food by themselves!! Important to know that the nursery ( the place you can observe young ones) is open only till 11 am. Probably it reopens later, however there were no sign about that. At 11 o'clock there is a short movie to watch about the center and it is a good one! ( showroom is where you leave you bag).You can also do some trekking, 4 km or smth.

For morning (10AM) feeding time I arrived at 9:15 and there were just few people watching playing and swing on the rope. Then I went to nearby nursery. Unfortunately the young Orangutanswere shy and did not come to play in front of the glass. Still, I enjoyed the cute ones playing there. But when I got back on the platform it was totally crowded. But apparently the UrangUtansdid not mind. I would like to remind you that this is not ZOO and the OrangUtansare semi-wild animals here so it is just matter of luck if you see them or how many. Even when the platform is closed after the feeding time there is a trial on which you can hike to a bird platform and to a waterfall (45 minutes walk one way). The cent rum is well maintained. You are not allowed taking any food or backpack inside but free lockers are available near the entrance. If you have no car or you do not pay a tour the transport is a bit tricky as the first bus (No.14) leaves Sandakanat 9:00 but journey takes 45 min. or you can take any (mini) bus passing junction mile 14 and then walk 2,5 KM or take the taxi. If you want to go to Semporna, Mt. Kinabalu park or KK. The bust stop at the junction (roundabout) in front of the Chinese shop."

The ticket price of 30 ringett per person admits you for both feeding times, one being 10 am the next 3 pm, 10 ringett extra for a camera. On both occasions we saw several orangutangs on the feeding platforms, but our best experience was to walk along the board walk just away from the viewing platform, where we saw several orangutangs playing very close to us in the jungle, then 2 walked along the boardwalk towards, and then straight past us, just about 1 foot away, this was amazing, one sat for a very long time on the hand rail, just feet from us, allowing us to get some great photos. I'd definatly recommend visiting the centre. The indoor nursery is definatly worth looking at while there, there were lots of young orangutang playing there, and that place is air conditioned if you need a Break from the heat!After we had a fantastic orangutang ice cream shake at the lindung cafe, up some steps just outside the gates of the centre, this was a much nicer place for a drink or lunch than the sanctury cafe."
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 30 March 2016,Friends,"We visited for the morning feeding session at 10am and went to the nursery around 9.30am. The very young Orangutan was just leaving the nursery but there were four adult Orangutan in the enclosure. Two of them were wild and had visited to get some free food. The only disappointment was that it was difficult to take quality photographs as we were behind glass that made everything a deep green. I am a keen amateur photographer so was slightly disappointed. However, there was a sanctuary guide on site to provide a lot of information about the animals and it was very informative. We left the nursery to attend the 10am feed of the adult Orangutans and were met on the pathway by a wild Orangutan and were within inches of the animal and it provided a great opportunity to take some close up photos. Once at the feeding platform we waited and eventually one Orangutan turned up for a free feed and she was called Mimi. As this was open air it was far easier to get some really good quality photographs. However, I would caution that you are in full sun and will need a hat and sunscreen to prevent burning. I would also recommend getting to the feeding platforms early to get your spot as there can be big crowds. If you were not at the front it would not be easy to take good photographs. When we departed the sanctuary at 10.40 it was already 37 degrees and the humidity was oppressive. I thin it is important to remember that there is no guarantee that the Orangutans will turn up for feeding time. The sanctuary is happy if they don't as they are becoming self sufficient but also appreciate that this can be disappointing for the tourist.We were lucky enough to see Orangutans in the wild in their natural habitat during our tour further into the jungle and get some wonderful pictures."

Kudos for the effort!However, despite all the praises sung for Sepilok, much can be done to further improve the experience. We find that the information and education pertaining to the Orangutans and their preservation was severely lacking.There were no staff around to help explain about the Orangutans and the much anticipated feeding-time was much like watching other people eating at a buffet; wished that they could have taken that opportunity of people gathering together to put up a sign explaining their diet, eating habits, daily activities etc.Yes there is a video presentation regarding the Orangutans at regular times during the day but not many will be so lucky to catch it in time. I feel sad for those who had to travel so far only to be met with an exhibition that could've been wrapped up in 15 minutes.As the old Malaysian saying goes ""Tak kenal maka tak cinta"" (It's hard to love what we don't understand); if we don't know about the Orangutans, wouldn't it be harder to teach the younger generations about the importance of their conservation?"

However the infants are brought out by the keepers so you will see them for certain.

They are open every day from 9 am to 4 pm. As a non-Malaysian, you pay RM30 entrance fee (RM15 for children). This includes an introductory video show about the work done for the orangutans at the sanctuary ‚Äì a nice starter to your day out. Even though they live independently in the reserve, you are guaranteed to see the orangutans. A few of them come down each day to a feeding platform, where staff offer them a variety of fruit.You are free to wander around the reserve to try to spot the various apes and birds at random, following a designated pathway. A good time to do this is during feeding time while most other tourists are busy taking snaps with their zoom lenses (the feeding platform is around 20 meters from the viewing deck ‚Äì there are two daily feeding sessions: 10 am and 3 pm).The orangutans can be quite curious, and there‚Äôs good chance you‚Äôll have some up close and personal encounters. As always with primates, keep your belongings attached to your body. They have been known to steal bags, cameras, rucksacks, and even the clothes off the backs of some unlucky visitors.After spending the morning in the main area of the Rehabilitation Center, we decided to try the longest of the available Nature Trails, which take you off the wooden pathways and out into the real rain forest.If you intend to trek around the reserve, wear trainers or boots to avoid feeding the leeches.After seeing the apes, you can also visit the Sun Bear reserve right next door, next to the main entrance.

The sanctuary is well set out with a walk through the rain forest and an opportunity to see the young orang utan in the 'nursery'. We saw three young ones in the nursery. Unfortunately we only saw two older adult Orang Utan come out at the feeding time. Hopefully many of the others had moved back into the wild. About 43 Orang Utan were at the Sanctuary at the time we visited. A place to be supported!

More walking is required than Semenggoh is Serawak, Borneo.  Sepilok did have a nursery enclosure but I preferred Semenggoh for feedings and in general if I had to choose one over the other.  One thing to note, the people who organized our visit (we wouldn't have done this) arranged for us to go on a public holiday so it was packed.  Very hard to see anything and just too many people, try to avoid busy holiday times.  We did see some amazing adult Orangutans and babies.  The sun bear enclosure was hard to see them and had many steps to climb to get up there, again, horrible during busy times.  There was a very good store for souvenirs.  All in all we saw orangutans and that's why we were there.  I would say to get a good visit in, it would be best to have 2 hours minimum and during the feeding time for sure."

If lucky you might see some orangutans freely playing in the trees when walking. If not going to the trail, you'll find the place very small and done in a short time  Timing is definitely not convenient and not helpful to do all depending the time you reach. "

The ticket is valid all day which is great as we stayed next door at Sepilok Nature Resort so were able to come and go as we pleased. You watch a video at 9am which gives you some good information about the work they do here for 'the men of the jungle'. Then everyone goes to watch the 10am feed at the platform and they come swinging out of the trees for a munch. The 2pm feed is much quieter but we saw them play around the walkways throughout the day, I even had a couple of close encounters as they walked past only inches away. You can break up the day by visiting the Sun Bear Conservation Centre which is only next door and well worth a visit. You can't take bags into the centre but lockers are provided, you also can't take drinks so drink lots of water before you go as it's super hot.

We saw all ages of orangutans and they all were healthy and happy!My ony advice is don't be rushed by the tour guides. I stayed down the road at the Sepilok Forest Edge and didn't hire a guide, but all the groups that did were on schedules.  You should spend an entire day there.  Be sure to be at the platform for the 10am feeding and be patient.  By 10:30 most people left to head to the nursery.  The guides said there were no orangutans in the area....We stayed with a few others and by 1:45 2 mature females arrived and started to enjoy the fruits on the platform!Afterwards we walked along the trails,  and enjoyed the beautiful rain forest jungle.   When we got back to the boardwalk area there were quite a few orangutans hanging around!   Go slowly and keep your eye on the branches and sounds of cracking branches....they love to swing and are great at it.   We saw a mother with her 18 month old infant...the guard let us watch her for over an hour...it was breath taking...In an ideal world we wouldn't need sanctuaries...but with deforestation and being held in captivity these beautiful creatures need our help....and they're doing a great job.  The orangutans are free to roam once they're out of the nursery.  Some never to be seen as they discover the beautiful 48 hectors of jungle they can safely call home..."
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 29 February 2016,Couples,A great place to see orangutangs and even though some say it's more like a zoo we felt we still saw orangutangs close to their natural habitat. There was a good short trail where you could use some time. But you have to be sure you drink plenty of water before you enter since you aren't allowed to bring water. So you have to take care you wont dehydrate if you take a longer walk!

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 29 February 2016,Solo,This sanctuary really exceeded my expectations. It was very clear that they had the animals best interests in mind instead of exploiting them. It's easy to tell a happy orangutan from a sad one and these animals were clearly very happy. It was great to see them behaving as they would naturally and nice to know that the adults have such freedom to roam around the park. I wish there were more facilities like this around the world in place of zoos.  Seeing animals in more natural setting is the only way you gain a real appreciation of how incredible and important they are.The keepers clearly have a real passion for these animals and their well being which was great to see. It was a definite highlight of my trip. Don't miss it!

There was a class of school children receiving a lesson on the apes and conservation part of the education programme provided by the Sanctuary.The work this group are doing to save the Orang Utans from extinction is impressive they could be extinct within a decade and the care and conservation will help to reverse that trend.This place is well worth a visit both to provide support for an excellent programme and to see the Orang Utan at close quarters.

A few bananas are placed on the feeding platform and they decide if they want to come down. Only 1 came the day I was there and although I was really disappointed nit to see more it is a fabulous sign that the rehab centre is doing its job well.it means these beautiful animals are not reliant on humans and are happy living in the natural environment .We were told later that the one that presented herself was an older very dominant female named Doris who scares off the others if she is in the mood for sum figs or bananas. They only open the rehab centre twice a day for 2 hrs so therefore it is jamm packed with cameras af the ready !!!! and very impersonal. This particular experienced orangatang seemed to resent the intrusion so sat with her back to us the whole time .the nursery is enjoyable as it is a purpose built hut that you can sit inside which is air conditioned. It has one way gas all around so the varies can't  see  you.. you can observe them frolicking about eating thier booty of fresh fruit and veggies.  They are just adorable as they learn to use the ropes and swings and play with each other.they are blissfully unaware you are watching .Although I was disappointed I only saw 1 ""kind of "" in the wild I am very glad i got to experience and see the good work the organisation's is doing .I also further developed an understanding of the challenges orangutans face as well as those trying to preserve thier habitat .I WAS LUCKY. .....later in my tour I did get to see more completly wild orangutangs with thier yiung which was amazing but also shows that some headway is being made into preserving these beautiful animals .Sepilok well worth a visit but don't come with expectations of a zoo .......you can also easily donate on line and sponsor  an infant for a very small amount of money "

Maybe I came here with the wrong image in my head but it was all far from a serene experience with screaming children, runing families, crying babys and wannabe paparazzi taking selfies.

We visited in the afternoon and spent twenty minutes watching the young animals in the nursery before attending the feeding session where we saw two teenage males feeding. We also bumped into one Orang Utan on the boardwalk. Access is a bit restricted and for that reason it is hard to avoid other visitors but if this reserve can help rehabilitate this magnificent creature it's worth it.
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 18 February 2016,Couples,"We were staying at the Sepilok Jungle Resort which is just a 5 minute walk down the road. After reading other reviews, we decided to arrive earlier than opening and we were glad to be there before all of the tour companies started to arrive. Entry is 30RM for internationals and a camera fee of 10RM is charged. If you're looking to see lots of orang-utan at one time then this probably isn't the place for you, as they are living semi-wild so the centre cannot guarantee any sightings. There is a 5-10minute board walk through the jungle before the feeding platform and if you are prone to insect bites, then I would heavily advice using a good repellent. You cannot take any bags inside but they provide lockers free of charge. All you can take in, is your camera. I thought that they should have at least allowed water inside, as the jungle area is very humid and people could end up passing out. Feeding is at 10am and 2pm, but we went down to the baby orang-utan nursery first as we had some time to kill. There were so many cute babies using their ""jungle gym"", showing off their skills and causing mayhem it was nice to take some photos of them but obviously, the glass protected them from us. It was nearing 10am, so we walked back down the board walk to the feeding platform where we were met by a tonne of people. It kind of ruins the experience and although the man feeding them tried his best to call for the orangutan-tan. Only 2 came, if you don't have a great camera then you probably won't get a good shot. Those who did, crowded round everybody and you would think that it was a photoshoot between them and the orangutan-tans. They should get their shot and move along for others to see. Like I mentioned, if you are hoping to see lots, then you just have to hope for the best as it just depends on the luck of the day. Maybe a zoo would be better for you. But it is nice to see them semi-wild and good to hear about the works of the rehab centre. "

We were fortunate to see many Orang Utans at feeding platforms, with a good view from the viewing platforms provided for visitors. We had a very close encounter with one Orang who decided that it wasn't fair that he should be getting wet in a downpour while we had shelter. Of course as soon as he arrived the keepers herded us all out, so we all got drenched and he stayed dry. The keepers were informative and clearly devoted to their charges and while it's shocking that such intervention is needed, Sepilok is an excellent facility for safeguarding and rehabilitating young Orangs.

Morning session was busy and we were lucky enough to see two orangutans at the feeding platform. The outdoor nursery also allows for a more ""up close"" look at the younger orangutans that are being rehabilitated within the centre. We had a few younger children on the platform at feeding time that were running around - this scared off the orangutans as they are shy animals. We were able to see the pigtail and long tail macaque (monkeys) which are very cheeky!The afternoon feeding session we didn't see any orangutans on the platform but further off in the jungle. We did however see a lot of the younger ones more active in the afternoon on the jungle gym in the outdoor nursery. We were informed by one of the rangers that it can be common for them not to come for feedings as they are encouraged to forage for food (one of their life skills). On our way out at closing time we did see one orangutan on the boardwalk and were able to watch it from about 10 meters away.There are no fences to keep the orangutans in (they are often spotted in the car park and along the boardwalks) and they are free to roam.Overall an amazing experience to see them in a semi-natural environment. Impressed with the conservation efforts made by the centre - the orangutans come first not the tourists, which is exactly how it should be."

There was nothing to see....Then at 3 PM there was a murmur among the waiting crowd. Soon after we saw flashes of orange and then they arrived. It was wonderful to watch their acrobatics in the trees, before jumping on to the platform. Then suddenly a huge chap decided to have some fun and climbed on to the watching area. He sat peacefully for us to take some photographs, then suddenly jumped up, raised his arms and took a few steps towards the crowd. The result ... panic. But he knew exactly what he was doing and did not chase us or try to touch us. We had an hour of fun with him, before the orangutan took us to the station for the babies. As the door was locked he moved carefully to one side so that even the most timid would be reassured and allowed us to enter the room from where the kids could be watched through a glass window.It was a wonderful experience and we felt fully justified in dropping Singapore in favour of Sepilok.

And you feel bad. And you want to leave. Because an animal being captive for show is just cruel and you don't want to witness that. Well, I do.This is not like this. If ever you wanted to see Orangutans, this is the way. Imagine, you walked into a jungle, and suddenly you are surrounded by those beautiful and incredibly adorable creatures. But it is clear, that it is their jungle. And in some sense it feels like they came to see you, and not the other way around. You realise, you are seeing free creatures, you are not witnessing imprisonment for fun; it feels like you are in the right place at the right time. I will separately report on all the other things in Sandakan to do, but I will have to take a side-step for one second: Next to the sanctuary for Orangutans, there's the sanctuary for the Sun bears - the smallest species of bears! They are a bit more shy than your average Orangutan, and for timing reasons we visited that first. Sun bears are adorable! However, the really memorable thing about the sun bear sanctuary was, that one of the orangutans was bored. She was so bored, she thought: Why not go for a stroll. So while we were standing around a telescope, watching sun bears, this little lady came walking towards us. And she was curious. We were standing on the viewing platform, when this Orangutan just came walking down the road, confident and happy, and more interested in us than we were in her. Sepilok will get you close to the Orangutans, but one-feet-away close in a random setting without staff around was something entirely different. We took so many great pictures and enjoyed the Orangutan's curiosity :) She went on to go into the reception building, causing a ""panic"" of sorts with a small tourist group that just arrived, not believing their eyes. I don't think this is a common occurrence, but maybe you'll get as lucky as we did? The Sanctuary itself is beautiful. The staff is fantastic and they tell you where to go, so you'll be able to see the Orangutans. Apart from the feeding, which is visited by many others than just Orangutans, the main spectacle of this place is the ""youth-center"". It's a sort-of Orangutan playground, where the younger once learn to climb, learn self-confidence and simply spend their time playing (also, one of the only places with air-con, so you might just enjoy that too). It is a blast. In our case, one young Orangutan played a game of catch with the staff. Orangutans aren't allowed on the ground (because the ground is sprayed with pesticides and the staff does not want them to drink that water for health reasons), however this one little cheeky guy made a game out of this. He waited for the staff to leave, to jump down and summersault on the ground, waiting for the staff to catch them, just to escape and tease them at the last second! Hilarious!  It is a fantastic visit. And in combination with all the other things you can do in Sandakan, definitely worth a visit. We opted in for the we-do-it-ourself tour. Instead of pre-booking, we decided to simply rent a car at the airport. Don't get me wrong, the tours are fine. The guides know where to go, when to go there. However, you end up being chased from one place to the other without much choice on what to do. We met this group of tourists who seem to always be at the same place that we were, but not long enough to witness all the funny little quaint things that made this place so unforgettable. Renting a car was RM50, gas was practically free (maybe RM10 for the day),  the driving conditions are perfect and you get to do whatever you want. We went to the other monkey sanctuary first ( proboscis monkey sanctuary), and stayed there for a bit. Note: EVERY sanctuary, arriving a bit early is worth it. None of the tour groups will arrive early, but sometimes, the staff will have some special treats. In almost every place we went, arriving early ended up with us being completely alone with the animals, before 60 people showed up to take 60 bazillion pictures. It was a quiet, and peaceful and felt much more natural. Definitely a great place to visit! Flights are cheap (from Kota, booked 3 days in advance, 30 pounds a person for a round trip). The flight takes 40 minutes, and everything is very close to the airport. If you are close. Go. Just go. Don't think, just do. You will not regret it."

We were fortunate, at the feeding the orangutans were happy to come along and eat. One mother was there with her baby which was also a lovely surprise. The baby was then trying to learn to swing which was cute. There is also the nursery where the younger monkeys are which provided great entertainment for us and them. Easy to also duck over to the sun bear centre across the road from here. Both are worth a visit. "

The gudie was extremely knowledgeable and made certain I had the best spot to see apes coming in for feeding.  You have to watch the ropes that come in from different parts of the sanctuary as the apes use them to get from place to place.  Only 3 apes came, but at east they came.  The rescued sunbears were also in view, one fast asleep in the sun and the others tearing a tree apart to get at termites."

I was initially a little worried that this place would feel like a zoo but this was not the case at all. We were even warned that we may not see the Orangutans if they did not come out for food - luckily they did! It's advisable to go in the morning for this reason. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting the area - it was certainly the main attraction for myself and it did not fail to meet expectations.

The orangutans are on their journey to the real world! Though it is not guaranteed that you will see these beautiful animals we were lucky to see about 6 of them. The only downside is that there are lots of people just wanting to take ""selfies"" with the orangutans - but that comes with a lot of places these days!

You get a locker to put your stuff in.The ticket is for a day visit but you can go in the morning to see them get fed & come back later to do some trails in the rainforest.On our walk we heard elephants trumpeting and rumbling, birds and saw snakes and some big lizards.Wear sturdy boots!! There's a souvenir shop with some cards, t-shirts & books. They have a cafe with some drinks a snacks.Also there's a information center showing an informative film about Orangutans & the rehabilitation they go through.

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 26 January 2016,,"First thing to remember about this place it's a Rehabilitation centre for Orang-utans.  The centre allowing tourists to visit is not it's main priority (although of course necessary for funding & education purposes). Saying that, it was incredibly well done, the broad walks are well maintained, the feeding platform is clearly visible from the whole of the viewing area & seeing the Orang-utans in a semi wild environment (especially Mum & baby) was absolutely fantastic! The rainforest there is primary forest & the huge trees alone are breathtaking. There are lots of birds & insects to see & giant squirrels too.The nursery viewing area is enclosed & you watch the youngsters from behind glass but once you understand the reasoning for setting up like this you understand why. Young Orang-utans are very susceptible to human born illnesses and they are trying to minimise human contact (curious babies are more likely to try & come say hello) - which would be lovely but not in the apes best interests. The shop is not great & I feel they've missed a fundraising opportunity there. It's really, really hot on the viewing platform & everyone was sweating massively so have a big drink before going (you can't take anything with you - only camera) and rehydrate afterwards. I personally loved it, felt very privileged that so many orang-utans decided to come eat & would recommend it to all! "
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 26 January 2016,Couples,"Chances are you won't have managed to see more than a glimpse of an orangutans in the wild, so the rehabilitation centre offers a great, ethical, means of getting up close and personal. The centre did have a bit of a commercial feel but I guess that is inevitable for such a popular attraction. The centre is well run and puts the animals rehabilitation as top priority. They do not guarantee that you well see any orangutans, although I guess the little ones will always be in the nursery. You could easily spend the whole day watching these cheeky monkeys! Feeding time is definitely the best time to see the big boys. It has a little bit if a staged feel about it, but these are still wild animals free to come and go as they please. After the feeding we watched, when most people had left, a couple of orangutans returned and spent half an hour playing right by the path. It was pretty special, so don't be in a rush to leave."

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 22 January 2016,Family,"This is a short, but extremely worthwhile thing to do.  There is the adult feeding, and the junior feedings.  Since this is a rehab centre the adults are encouraged to live in the wild and often don't show up, that being said, just walking around the park will give you a close encounter with one or more of the Orang-utans.  If you have a bit more time you can do the walks (upto 5k) through the park, but be prepared to walk on muddy jungle trails."

We went twice as we went in the morning and it was raining and didn't get to see much at all and it was very slippery I slipped a few times as so did a few other people. I would recommend if it's raining in the morning wait it out and go in the afternoon. We went back in the afternoon and they were all out it was amazing and the path had dried up so no more slipping.

It's worth coming in earlier to watch the video or enjoy the stroll towards the feeding platform and hang out at the outdoor nursery. There was much more activity in the afternoon where we saw 7 orang utans and a few near the boardwalk as well, where in the morning only one showed up. We also saw a mousedeer, squirrels, hornbills and many other monkeys. Unfortunately we missed the sign that the trails were only open until 2pm, so when we came back in the afternoon to do the trail walks, they were closed already. Altogether we spent 4 interesting and enjoyable hours in the sanctuary, just sorry the trails close quite early."

They ask you to arrive at least half an hour before feeding which takes place at 10am & 3pm daily. The entrance fee for locals is 1/6th the price visitors/tourists pay, which for Adults is RM30. You also pay extra if you wish to use/carry your camera, another RM10.They provide lockers (free of charge) to put your belongings in as NO bags are allowed, not even a camera bag.This is a great place to visit & see these shy primates up close. There is a large tiered viewing platform with a caged roof (very necessary) & thick ropes going to the feeding platform from several directions. Everyone watching remained pretty quiet while these primates fed. All you hear is the clicking of cameras & the odd bit of laughter as a cheeky squirrel/ macaque/younger orang-utan sneaks in to snatch something to eat & take off again. Some of the younger ones were quite entertaining.On our afternoon visit a youngster was clapping while hanging from one of the ropes. He then came in & stood on the feeding platform in a pose to show us all his muscles, then raced across a toward the viewing platform on the arrival of a ""wild"" orangutan. He then wandered across the caged roof above all the visitors, jumped into some trees playfully & finally back onto the caged roof, over to the front of it, laid on his belly & stuck his head over the edge looking down on everyone. He remained there while all the other orangutans came in to feed, one by one. Once most of the viewers had moved on to check out the nursery, he headed back along the front of the roof to the rope, stopped & piddled onto the platform before leaping onto the rope & in to feed. Very cheeky! We also saw a pregnant female ""hanging"" in there also waiting to feed, definitely a pecking order amongst them.It's a short walk from there to the nursery where there are 2 glassed-in rooms to view the young ones as they play with one another on ropes & jungle gyms, having a ball. It's a fabulous set up, not to be missed. Every day is different, no doubt about it. You also see these creatures as you wander through the jungled walk ways, sometimes up close!

The public viewing areas can get quite full at times so I would definitely suggest going more than once as the experience will be different every time. We saw only 2 Orangutans on our first visit with lots of public around but on the second day our visit in the afternoon showed hardly anyone about and we had the privilege of seeing 7 Orangutans arrive at the platform.

At first she was just walking on the railing, then approached the three of us while other visitors stood nearby, taking advantage of a photo opportunity :) Then she reached out to me for what looked like a hug, however, she ended up grabbing my cell phone (in a non-aggressive and very calm manner), so we just stood there for a couple of minutes, both of us holding onto the phone and looking at each other, until my boyfriend reached over and took it away from us. After that the orang utan walked away and slowly disappeared into the woods. As she was relatively small and looked very calm and non-aggressive, it didn't feel scary at all and was the most exciting moment of our trip. We also managed to get a selfie with her :) In addition to this unexpected close up experience, we saw 3 orang utans during the morning feeding and 4 more during the afternoon one. The afternoon feeding became a bit of a show as some monkeys decided to join the meal and the orang utans turned out to be selective about which monkeys they shared their food with. Overall, a very nice and interesting experience. I highly recommend paying a visit to Sepilok Orang Utan centre.Costs: we didn't make any bookings, so taxi from the airport 40 MYR, landed on the morning flight from KL, went straight to the sanctuary, arrived just in time for the 10 am feeding (no checked luggage though). There are free lockers that easily fit a carry on/large back pack. Entrance fee was 30 MYR per adult (foreigners, it is cheaper for Malaysian residents and kids), camera fee 10 MYR. There is a small cafe for lunch/snack, fairly cheap. Taxi to Sandakan city 50 MYR (there were several cars there, available for hire).

If you want to see orangutan whilst in Borneo come here, they have a powerful philosophy of rehabilitation and conservation unlike many other places that have captive rescued orangutan for tourists to experience.Feeding times are at 10am and 3pm, a film is shown at staggered times through the day, go see this, it gives context to the work going on here and the wider picture of challenges facing orangutans in the wild.When we visited for a ten am feeding time only a few orangutan came as most were deep in the forest feasting on the fruits there at this time of year, several orangutans did come including a mother and baby and two juvenile males who oblivious to everyone on the viewing platform put on quite a sustained display of wrestling and play fighting which was the best to experience.We also went to the viewing area of the outdoor nursery area, it was an unobtrusive way to watch the younger orangutan training in the skills they will need to survive in the forest.So go experience this place and get an idea of the issues facing orangutan survival and Borneo as a whole. Don't just be one of those tourists who shows up on a bus for feeding time, takes pictures then gets back on the bus, take time to experience this place, and also don't forget to visit the sunbear rehabilitation centre opposite, they are doing pioneering rehabilitation work, orangutans aren't the only species under threat in Borneo."

Getting there is easy  A 35 minute Airasia flight from Kota Kinabalu takes you to Sandakan and a quick 30 minute drive from the airport gets you there. Someone short on time could even do it as a day trip from KK if you get a cheap enough fare on Airasia! Remember that this is not a zoo or circus act so there is no way to predict how many orangutans you'll see per feeding so it is recommended you do both the morning and afternoon feedings - which are both included in the total price. In the morning we saw three orangutans that had been rehabilitated and release and I didn't think it could get any better then that! They were fascinating to watch and I loved every second. The afternoon feeding is at 3 but we got there at 2 pm to get a good view. Turned out to be a good choice - we were the first to the platform and discovered 2 orangutans hanging out on the steps playing and throwing branches at each other. The staff was quick to get between us and the orangutans for obvious safety reasons but for about 30 minutes we watched them play by ourselves about 10-15 feet away and it was breathtaking. Once the rest of the platform filled up they left but a bunch of the wild orangutans came in for the feeding. Overall we saw about 15 that afternoon.  This place is such a good cause and I cannot recommend it enough.
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 13 December 2015,,"The volunteers here do an amazing job! Unfortunately deforestation is a big problem here in Borneo and the orangutans suffers a lot since they soon have no rainforest to live in. At this center there are no fence keeping the animals inside and they are free to move around how ever they want. They just keep the young orangutans inside a facility at night since they usually are with their mother for protection until they are 7 years old and therefore would not survival in the wild at that young age. We saw at least 10-15 orangutans and they all seems really happy. It is so important to support these kind of facilities that actually focuses on what is best for the animals, instead of what attracts more tourists. "

The guys there do a good job saving this endangered specie and one can actually see the large monkeys coming. Feedings are at 10am and 3 pm, while the afternoon one is more rewarding. The reason is that tour groups seem to arrive for the morning one. Hence the 3pm session is more quiet and orang-utans are not scared away by shouting Malaysian kids or Italian tourists (as it was the case when I was there). The adjacent sun bear sanctuary is also well worth a visit. In between feedings you can explore Rainforest Discovery Center (RDC), which is around 15 min walk back towards the main road. The RDC features a canopy walkway and an extensive network of jungle trails. It is worth exploring! The RDC basically does not close so it is worth visiting the canopy walkway again during sunset time to see nocturnal animals to wake up.  There is also accommodation and affordable restaurants available near both RDC (Sepilok Bed and breakfast) and the SORC (several affordable lodges). No need to stay in Sandakan town. Taxi to the airport was 40 RM one way. When I was there taxis were allways available at the SORC gate - even until late evening. Sunbear sanctuary, SORC and RDC are all within walking distance."

The orangutans are supposedly rehabilitated and released into the wild but then feeding them doesn't really serve that purpose so...I'm not sure if this is more of a zoo than a rehab centre. You can view the nursery behind glass which is probably to ensure the monkeys can't see the humans on the other side, making rehab easier but that's my understanding of it. Located in a lovely forest but not sure of the ethics of this just yet."

2.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 28 November 2015,Couples,"Do you like watching animals in the zoo? Well, you might like this. But  just with orang utans. You can't bring anything like big camera bag (but nowhere is specified which size is considered big) or any other bag with water or something. Which kinda sucks when it's raining. You can leave your stuff in the boxes outside, but we had to come back three times until the keepers were satisfied. Feeding is the best chance to see some orang utans, we have seen three of them. Because of rain, it seemed all of the animals were hidden somewhere. There were some orang utan babies in the nursery and you can watch them playing behind the glass walls in separate building. It really feels like in the ZOO. Surprisingly, there wasn't much information boards, just some fun facts about the animals and few profiles of the favourite ones with name etc. (ZOO feeling again). They say the orang utans need to spend here about 10 years until they are ready to come back to the wild. 10 years, really?! You can also read they get just monotonous food like bananas only, to encourage the animals to find something by themselves. But during the feeding, we have seen plenty different kinds of fruits. So?There is also a longer trail through the forest, where you can watch some birds. We ask if there is a chance to see some when it's heavy raining, the stuff told us they just don't know. The answer was no. After half kilometer long walk through mud in the trail, completely dirty, wet and eaten alive by mosquitoes, we went back without seeing anything. This experience was truly disappointing. If you are considering visiting just one of the centres here, better choose The rainforest rehabilitation centre. Half of the price, so much information and much better experience. And if you're lucky, you can see some orang utans there. "

The nursery area has an enclosed viewing area with seating. The outside viewing area for the older Orang Utans is largely uncovered. We had waterproofs and an umbrella but many other visitors didn't.  Protective clothing is available in the small shop but the sign says it has limited opening hours.  Give yourself plenty of time, the sanctuary covers a large area and if you want to see the film show you should get there early before feeding time. Well worth travelling from KK for the experience. The Orang Utan are much easier to photograph here than in the wild. Incidentally, you have to pay a nominal fee to use a camera; mobile phones/tablets are free."

We went to 3 feedings over 2 days and the apes are further away from you than anywhere else, they just sit and eat with their backs to you with an occasional glance towards the fans. The sun is either in your eyes or too low behind you for really good photographs. They charge you an extra 10 ringits to being your camera in which you dont use that much because you know the pictures will come out poorly. The nursury has you sit in an air conditoned building looking through glass that is difficult to take pictures through and again the apes are far away compared to other locations in Borneo. The staff only is friendly with you when they think you may be staying overnight so that they can sell you a night walk to make some overtime pay.They could be doing great work to rehab the orangutans but showing their work to the visitors is not a priority at all here. In Semonngoh you feel the beauty of the apes coming in to feed from the wild and the returning. Here its more like they walk off stage yawning.  In Sepilok you do not get this wild sense at all...because these apes perhaps are not as rehabbed as those at Semongoh..?..but because you are not allowed to go to the other platforms you can never see the wildest of the apes...it almost feels like you are put on a conveyor belt to see 2 apes picking fruit out of a basket or off the deck while they placidly sit there. When the food is gone they walk off stage. There is little interaction between the apes. The squirrels and occasional other monkeys that come in are far more entertaining than the Orangutans...and we ADORE these apes. The facilities...ie bathrooms cafeteria, gift shop are superior to all of the Orangutan haunts, bur who cares about that? And Sepilok is 50 percent more expensive AND you have to pay a few dollars extra to bring in any kind of camera!It is not very fun or beautiful at Sepilok...go to Semongoh instead if you can possibly do it...otherwise just go to a zoo in your local city at home and go to Labuk Bay Proboscis Santuary or almost anywhere else. Sepulik is really the last place to go if you have a choice."

This is a rehabilitation and preparation sanctuary for release of orphans into the wild. In the wild these orphans would stay with their mother and learn skills for about 7-10 years, the rangers here take on that role and gradually pull back, and encourage them to be free spirits before immersing them fully into the wild. This is an amazing place. Orang Utan's are endangered, so if you don't see many, well there is reason for that!! But with the work going on here, hopefully we keep these beautiful cousins around.

We didn't see any orangutans on our trip up the Kinabatangan and this was a really lovely morning watching these incredible animals. It's a large reserve with no cages etc. Yes they are fed so that you can get to see them on the feeding platform but it's all very natural and I'd definitely recommend going. You are not 100% sure of seeing one in the wild anyway!!

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 12 November 2015,Friends,"We visited the reserve twice.  The first time was the afternoon feeding.  We went on our own without a guide.  We were incredibly lucky in that one of the more precocious juvenile males was very playful.  He was on the viewing platform with all the tourists.  The keepers were vigilant about having us keep our distance, but he was quite the ham.   He was absolutely hilarious.  We ended up following him around the boardwalk for at least an hour.  We were able to get so close, but remain at a safe distance.  Again, was he was so funny and the orangutans are amazing animals.  We visited the next morning with a guide.  It was more crowded and we didn't get quite as close.  It was still interesting and amazing to see the orangutans and I didn't mind going a second time.  But I think the first day was a rare occurrence.  We definitely got lucky.  I would recommend going to this reserve as you won't have the opportunity to get as close while in Malaysia.  The wooden boardwalk made it easy to navigate.  Be prepared to lock up everything you're carrying except your camera.  The orangutans are quite resourceful and naughty and will try to grab your belongings.  Again, they are amazing!"

Although there was a local school trip, it was fairly quiet. We'd not even walked 100m in to the canopy and an Orangutan came down to see us and sat on the fence beside us.  It is perfectly safe along as you remain in silence. We were then watching from the feeding platform and one crept up on us from nowhere. It was very calm but it started to climb on to my mum and hold her hand.  The guides were quick to react thankfully and moved everyone away from her. They then spent 5mins trying to get the Orangutan away. It made for some great photos but probably not for the feint hearted.There is an air conditioned viewing area of the younger ones playing outside which is funny to watch but this shut promptly at 4pm so do arrive and be ready at 2pm.we paid 80MYR for a taxi which waited for the 2hrs at the sanctuary which I'm sure is overpriced but hey it's still a site cheaper than the tours."

Ask about times) for only 5 Rg.Cost to get in is 30 Rg and an extra 10 Rg for cameras.  There are two feedings, 10:00 and 3:00  It's worth going to both.  We found it works well to catch a cab out for the first feeding which lasts about 45 minutes.  It's from a viewing platform but the Apes are wild and come in to the feeding platform about 40 away to suplement their diet.  That feeding ends and is times to allow you to then wander over to a separate building where you can view them feeding the adolescent Orang Utans which aren't ready to be released full on into the wild yet.After that you can take a long walk into the reserve if you want although you'll need good shoes as it can be a bit muddy.  in fact you can arrange to walk all the way through the reserve to the coast and catch a boat back to Sandakan.  I wish we'd known about this as you get right into the jungle where you can (although don't necessarily) see the Orang Utans in their element, not to mention various bird and snake species.  You can also wander over to the Sun Bear Rehab Centre which is right beside the Orang Utan Sancturary.  It's another 30 Rg to get in and all you get to do is walk to a viewing platform and see them wandering around in their enclosure.  The ones you see are teh bears that can't be released.  The bears that they want to release are in areas further away from people.  for $10 i guess it's a once in a lifetime but you'll probably be disappointed in what you get.After you've don't all that you can go to a 2pm talk/film on the history of the Orang Utan Sancturary which is coordinated to finish just in time to go to the 3pm feeding.  When that's done walk out and catch the bus back into town.It's a good day trip and they have a cafeteria with reasonable cheap and safe food options for lunch.  There's also a Wildlife/Canapy Walk Centre about 1 Km up the road from the Orang Utans but i think it's hard to fit that in on the same day and we decided to skip it.

This is the first time I've returned to SORC since the nursery opened & it is an excellent addition which provides an opportunity to see the playful toddlers even if the feeding platforms fail. I also recommend doing the trail walk in the interim between feeding times (your ticket covers both) as we were followed for almost two hours by a young female orangutan, an experience that we will never forget.

Sepilok is incredibly well organised with the animals at the heart of everything they do.  Once feeding is over, hang around at the back for a bit and wait for all the crowds to disperse and if you're lucky then there will be some more Orangutans come in from the wild when it's quieter.  A few tips:  If you want to do the bird walk then make sure you are wearing at least trainers, ideally boots as the walk ways soon stop and you are walking on the rain forest floor and there are leeches!

Typically on most organised tours you only get to see one of the feeds. They are fed at 10am and 3pm. A taxi from our hotel was only MYR 60 (one way) and he agreed to come back and collect us, making the total trip 120 (about ¬£25). We paid at drop off back to the hotel.The entrance fee was 30 ringgit each. You can't take your back pack in but they provide free lockers and you will need to pay 10 ringgit to take a camera in. Remember to take some insect repellent in your bag, even if you put in on before you go as its so humid it will soon sweat off. Only one orang-utan showed up for the 10am feeding so after this we went to see the youngsters in the outdoor play area. Once they were called in we walked the bird trail where one orang-utan approached us on the path and started to chew mine and my husbands shoes. She even grabbed hold of my husbands hand...just magical! Beware though some of the orang-utans are not so friendly and it is recommended you keep your distance. We decided to go back to see the 3pm feeding so between 12.30-2.30 we had some lunch and then went to the Borneo sun bear sanctuary which was 33 ringgit each. At the 3pm feeding there were many more orang-utans, including a mother and baby and a naughty make the Rangers had to keep away from us.The whole day was just magical being near by these beautiful animals and I would highly recommend spending all day there, there is plenty to do.

Definitely worth the trip over.. Adopt an orangutan while you are there and help Borneo save these little guys... 
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 21 October 2015,Friends,"Having heard this described as a bit of a rip off and not actually a sanctuary but only a  showplace for tourists. I have to disagree.... the Orang Utans appear to be semi wild with baby's having been rescued when mothers were killed. They live as a family and are taught survival skills to enable them to be re habituated back into the wild. Some are never seen again, others have stuck around mated and had several offspring... The poor things have so little habitat left in the wild because of the extensive encroaching palm oil plantations that this can only be a good thing. We glimpsed only 2 in the Kinabatangan river  area, and apparently were very lucky at that, so if you want to see them you really do have to come here."

Although the menu was a little limited the manageress, Caroline, whos husband is a park warden. did her best to accomodate every one and even had a fridge full of Stellas. The centre offers two feeding times where the visitor can watch the Urangutans being fed and one evening showed a short film which records the centres humble beginings to the present day sanctuary and its outstanding conservation work. One morning I hiked through the forest along a little used trail and emerged some two hours later in another National Park. The forest was filled with butterflys of all sizes and colours, lizards which crashed through the undergrowth and the wind which rustled through the canopy. The return to the centre was either by trekking back or by speed boat which weaved its way through the mango swamps. A fantastic stay filled with many happy memories."

It is an amazing experience watching the wild orangutans make their way to the feeding platforms.The sanctuary is far from Kota Kinabalu, about an 8 hour bus ride and you need to stay for a night at the minimum to be able to catch one of the feedings.The feedings which happen at 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. draw huge crowds and the orangutans being the shy, intelligent creatures they are know exactly how to keep the crowd hooked on while getting their privacy. The adolescents ones in the nursery entertain you a lot more since the wild ones disappear once they have had their fill and are not easy to spot in the forests of the rehab center. You can watch the orangutans in the nursery through glass enclosures till 11.30 a.m.and can choose to walk the many trails, if you wish. It is truly a special experience to watch the orangutans as they are rehabilitated.The entrance fee is MYR 30 and an additional 10MYR for cameras. You must leave your bags, including water bottles, at the baggage counter at the entrance."

The best part was at the end when an orang-utan arrived on the roof of the visitors centres as we we leaving (close enough for a selfie as he sat above on the roof).... From what we were told this was quite rare.  But from opening at 0900, went straight to the nursery and saw all the younger orang-utans playing on ropes and platforms, they were within 4-30 metres behind glass. 10am went to the viewing platform with the noisy hordes, but had a view directly in front. 2 females and a baby came down to eat the bananas. We stayed for 40 minutes while they moved to different platforms, the baby was very playful on the ropes. The car park experience described above was amazing. Then went over to the sun bear sanctuary, RM30 to get in as well, was great, we saw 3 sun bears foraging on the ground and way up trees eating bark, before feeding time, you need to be right at the front to see well.

You're asked to leave your bags in the lockable lockers provided.  When we visited it was very, very hot and humid, make sure you put insect repellent on before you go in.  Watching the babies in the nursery was very entertaining.  We saw two adults on the feeding platform in the morning and another three in the afternoon.  The ticket lasts all day so you can return later if you wish (we were staying just down the road).  No need to dress up in safari gear either, most folk were wearing tees, shorts and sandals.  I gave this 4 stars simply because I enjoyed the orangs at Semengoh more, this was a bit touristy for me."

The centre has an air conditioned auditorium so you can sit for as long as you like to watch the kindergarten kids!  These orang-utans are around 2 years old and are true entertainers!  No one leaves without a smile on their face.  The outside boardwalk has a feeding platform for the wild orang-utans to come and feed.  We were lucky enough to see 4 of these beauties eating a range of fresh fruits, you can stay and observe them for as long as you like.  Walking along the boardwalk we also witnessed a young orang-utan building his day nest just metres from the walk! Take a bottle of water with you."

The Rehab Centre seems to be very well run and the care of the animals are first and the tourist are second, which I always like to see.  Overall this is a must visit!"
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 8 October 2015,Friends,"Arrived at the airport with no idea on getting around so hired a cab for the day. Told the driver where we wanted to go and got to Sepilok about 30 minutes before the talk that was provided by the people running the Centre. This was very informative and set up the rest of the experience. We were shown a path to follow and this had a raised wooden path that meandered through the bush. The guide was identifying plants, trees and animals as we went. We were able to see animals in the trees at a distance till we arrived at the lookout for the feeding session. There was a wooden amphitheatre arrangement which allowed clear view of the forest in front and the feeding platform. He guides explain not to use flash on camera's at the orang-utans but there is always some idiots however this did not stop the appearance. Once the food was laid out on the platform a range of monkeys turned up, and it was only after a time that the orang-utans showed. Just stunning to watch and easy to identify different animals  by the marks. There were several mothers with babies which people just loved. On the way back after the session ( which lasted some time) we were lucky to have a juvenile in a tree beside the path drop down to the railing and watch the people. Again idiots were taking photo's with flash in its face, which spoilt the event - well until told the camera would end up somewhere unpleasant and they stopped. Then as quickly as it appeared it was gone. To be so close - only over a metre away was an incredible experience. Once back to the camp you walk thru the Tourist  shop with tee shirts etc. When you are going thru you become aware that part is run by the volunteers who put the funds back into the centre and another part which is just a money maker for a shop keeper. If going then check before purchasing memento's . Easy to spot the Volunteers as most are western people helping out but the product is great."

Despite this we still had some great opportunities to watch these beautiful animals. The nursery area allows you to watch some of the young orangutans play from an indoor viewing area. The fact that this is airconditioned is lovely, but viewing the animals through the glass felt a bit more artificial. The centre is well managed, well maintained and provides a great conservation service. Well worth a visit."

After this we made our way to the feeding viewing area where we saw four Orangutans which was amazing we also saw a viper chilling in a tree. We then went to watch a video on all the fantastic work this place does for the Orangutans. This place is definitely worth a visit for any orangutan lover.

And my afternoon and day at Sepilok Orang Utan Sanctuary did not disappoint... yes I went twice! It was amazing. The rangers and staff here are so friendly and informative! I went first for the afternoon feeding, it was cool and not too busy, I headed for the nursery where you can watch younger Orangutans swinging around their nursery, being cheeky and playing with each other, there were lots of them here this afternoon. And then I headed to the main feeding platform where 3 of them sat eating... I could have sat here for hours watching them, it was so peaceful and a lovely experience. I visited again later in the week for the day, the morning feeding was much busier and noisier, only 2 of them feeding, and sharing their breakfast with mackaks. In the nursery we saw a mothee and have  baby as well as all the young orangutans again playing and being naughty. If you do one of the trails I'd advise to go back and get some water as its longer than you think and hot in the midday. What an amazing day and a half. And a fantastic experience. The work being done here to conserve and save these beautiful animals is truley incredible! "

Arrived at Sepilok about 8.30am, had breakfast at the excellent and cheap cafe before going into the reserve. You have to leave everything except cameras in the lockers (even camera cases). It's 30 MYR to enter plus 10 MYR for cameras- we assumed this was 10 MNR per person with a camera and not 10 MYR per device. As everyone has cameras (even if on a phone) I don't know why they don't just make the entry fee 30 MYR.Saw both feedings (10 am  and 3 pm)- the afternoon is definitely quieter and more peaceful. The nursery where you watch the younger ones is great because it is air conditioned- it is very hot and steamy.As the centre is closed between 12 and 2 this is a good opportunity to visit the sun bears and cool down in the cafe.Did find it a little difficult to get a taxi back to the airport- I would have thought there would be more taxis around at 4th which is kicking out time- although we did see an orang utang in the car park after which was an added bonus.Overall a great experience, and everything is done with the orang utangs best interest at heart. The rangers were also great and clearly care about the orange utangs. "

Animals come and go as they please. We went at 10 for the feeding and were quite disappointed with that part. Too far away to see them up close. We then went and watched the babies playing with the volunteers. Very cute but again not up close. Most of the tourists left on their busses but we hung around for a bit and bang had the treat of a lifetime! 2 orangoutangs came down from the trees to check us out! So cute and gentle! Of course we didn't pet them as they are very susceptible to our germs but we did watch them no more than 2 feet from us for about 15 mins. They seemed very curious about us and liked to show off for us. We felt completely safe at all times. We also did the night tour there. It was ok but not as exciting as I expected. More of shining a flashlight on a tree far away and everyone pretending to see something.. It's all hit or miss no guarantees.

You can also watch a video while you wait durin the break between feedings. I enjoyed this place very much, and the orangutangs walk around freely so if you're little lucky you can actually get really close to them! The only negative thing was that it was a bit crowded and a lot of children running around screaming etc.., which was a bit disturbing for the experience.

Expect a few accidental elbows from late-comers to encourage you to give up your spot.  Even if you are not at the rail, you'll get a great view.The Orang Utans didn't disappoint.  They climb to their feeding deck via ropes and a little ladder.  The whole thing lasts about 30mins and is extremely entertaining.  It was great.There's a little shop, as you'd expect.

All in all a great day, just maximise your chances of seeing orangutans by staying for both sessions.

You only have a set time in which you can visit and when all tourists are coming at the same time,  as we all know, nature will not be seen if noise. They bring food out to attract the orangutans on a platform but like I've said loud,  rude tourists ruined it.

We had an early morning flight from Kota Kinabalu, transfer to the airport from the hotel, make sure you have your e-ticket as you will need to use the self service check in to get your boarding passes, you are very much dropped at the airport and left to sort yourselves out, which is fine, as long as you know, make sure you follow signs for Sabah domestic as it would be easy to end up in the international side. We were met at the Sandakhan airport by the local guide for Borneo Tour & Incentive and started our trip, guide very informative and Sepilok do such good work, we even adopted an Orangutan called Beryl. We also visited the local market and floating village and paid extra to go to the sun bear conservation area, next to Sepilok, which was also very interesting. Again the transfer to the airport for our return trip, we were dropped off and left to it, again which was fine, as very easy airport, however we were dropped off at 1615 for 1945 flight, as 2 other couples on our tour were booked on the 1810 flight, so unfortunately we had nearly a 4 hour wait,and there really is not a lot on this side of the airport to occupy yourselves.

Visited twice over 10 days. Both visits were about the same experience one at 10.00am other at 15.00. Good services/bathrooms and a welcome cooler restaurant which served curries, toasties, burgers/chips and other snacks and cold drinks (fair prices as well). Pleasant 10min walk through rain forest along a wooden decking pathway to viewing platform and a little further to the nursery area for the young Orangutans. Feeding time for the young ones is at 9.00 so get there early to see this as they are so playful, then at 10 (hopefully the adults come out of the forest) to the feeding platform about 20- 30 metres away from the viewing area.... cameras/binoculars at the ready and prepare to be taken in by them. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE  1. any one with young ones from wherever in the world try to keep them quiet as it does spoil the experience for others but I do know how difficult this can be! and 2. TURN OFF YOUR PHONES!!!. The apes are beautiful and a rare opportunity to get close to them. We were lucky to have one come out of the forest just in front of me - 2ft away it reached out for me but the rangers/guides were close and asked us not to touch them and be slow and quiet so as not to scare him/her. The rangers/guides were brilliant and rightly so with the instructions so as not to pass germs back and forth. All in all a great experience.

We set off on the boardwalk through the jungle keeping an eye out for animals.  The feeding time was 10:00, so we went to the orphanage area first.  Here, we were behind a glass enclosure and could see young orangutans playing and eating on the outdoor wood playground structure. I grabbed a spot up front and plopped down on the floor to take photos.  It was so cool seeing all those adorable orangutans interact.  They are just so dang cute.  Some aggressive macaque monkeys showed up and scared the little guys off.  Those macaques are little piglets hogging all the fruit.  I think we saw six orangutans there.We headed to the platform where the outdoor feeding was underway.  Ahh -- so amazing.  We weaseled our way to the front and watched the action, capturing it as best we could with our cameras.  The orangutans would hang upside down, jump around, and really get into eating the fruit.  A large macaque showed up and scared the orangutans off.  Damn!  Ramen said the orangutans were gone for good (because of screaming human brats) and suggested we check out the video in the info center, but we stayed at the platform.  Good decision.  Two orangutans arrived, swinging from the ropes to the platform. So cute!  They jumped around above us moving through the trees overhead.  Sepilok kicks people out at 11:00, and just before leaving an orangutan climbed up the boardwalk structure and walked among us -- its little arms sticking out to the side.  So cute!  One of the rangers took him away by the hand.  When my friend, Karin, went to Borneo, she only saw a glimpse of an orangutan.  We certainly got lucky.The next day we returned to Sepilok and went off to the outdoor nursery to enjoy the action.  There were fewer orangutans this time and not as many macaques (plus they were well behaved).  There were also fewer tourists.The orangutan feeding took place at 10:00 a.m.  It started off slow with very few orangutans.  There was one little guy who kind of hung out in the visitor area climbing the shade structure.  So cute.  He would walk on top of it as well, and our guide warned us not to be underneath him in case ‚Äòsomething‚Äô dropped on top of us.  There were a few orangutans eating on the platform and three new ones came swinging in.  It was cool to watch them.  Eventually two mamas holding their babies joined in the fun.  I couldn‚Äôt see the babies‚Äô faces, but they looked so cute from a distance gripping mom.  I‚Äôd say the nursery portion of the day was better on our first visit, but the feeding platform was even better the second day."

I would advise that you find out what the feeding times are for both the feeding areas & the closing times before you go cos you may want to allow extra time or day.  We sadly missed the nursery feeding.  Experience of a life time.  Enjoy this special place.

We then made our way to the viewing point overlooking the feeding platform.  Long and short tailed macaques, attracted by the food on offer, were the warm-up act which was very amusing.  In total on the day of our visit 6 orang-utans (including a mother and baby) made their way to the platform. They were so lovely to watch and so human-like in their facial expressions.  This was a highlight of our holiday in Sabah.  Make sure you don't miss the toddler nursery - we watched 4 young orang-utans out to play on the climbing frames.  Also, pay a visit to the Sun Bear Conservation centre on the same site."

Ideally you shouldn't see any, then they've done their job properly as the monkeys have made their way back into the jungle. We saw two. But it's still worth going and supporting the cause. "

It was great to see that it is not like that.The monkeys are free to move in the entire area, and to even leave the rehabilitation centre and disappear into the forest if they wanted to. There are two feedings a day at which you can watch them most likely. The rest of the rehabilitation process happens rather without people around. Some of the visitors unfortunately seem to forget that they observe wild animals here...The people at the center do a great job for the animals! And as for the sun bear conservation centre - the money visitors bring in does help the animals! "

The facilities were stroller friendly and the toilets were clean.Our only issue was that it was unclear online before we came that everything closes between 12 and 2pm. Apart from the cafe. We had not made plans for the middle of the day. We were Traveling with our 6 month old so were limited in the nearby things we could do. We assumed the centre and boardwalks would be open all day but they weren't. We spent a lot of time in the cafe and visitor centre to make use of the aircon but had we known we would have not done it as a day trip but as an overnight from KK where we could have had the use of a hotel nearby to escape the midday sun and heat.Aside from the feedings there is little to do in the area unless you have figured something out before hand and have the details ready.

And anyway, you go there to contribute, right? Hope you go on a river safari too, there you might also see truly wild orangs. We saw 6 on our first day and felt blessed. The Sukau Rainforest Lodge was just charming: pretty place with a small swimming pool and even a bar, in addition to all the wildlife cruises, walks and talks, Very environmentally conscious and also of sustainability; no AC, rainwater used efficiently, only sometimes use of gasoline engines in the boats (mostly electric engines), employment of local people, Very good food and cosy atmosphere with all guests gathering for dinner on the river at the same time, wearing the provided sarongs. Small groups in the cruise boats which is good so as not to disturb the wildlife."

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 9 September 2015,Friends,"This is the next best thing to seeing orangutans in a completely wild environment, so if your limited with time it's perfect. There's no cages/fences so even the rescued juveniles are free to go if they choose. The purpose is to look after injured or orphaned orangutans with the aim of encouraging them to leave again to live in the wild. Contact is kept as minimal as possible within the limits of looking after them, especially the juveniles which do need a level of contact to survive and to be encouraged to learn the skills to live in the jungle, such as climbing etc.You could argue that the feeding platform is a bit controversial, but despite the negatives it's a good way to entice people in and increase their awareness/education about these magnificent creatures , and the income from tourism is essential to keep the centre running. On the whole they keep the food boring to encourage the orangutans to seek out more interesting foods on their own. We went here twice during our 8 day stay in borneo and also did the night walk."

We were staying in K.K. so had to fly but we also went to Turtle Island on this trip so it was well worth the travel. We arrived shortly before feeding time as this is when you are most likely to see an Orangutan and were very lucky that I spotted one in the trees before we got down to the feeding platform. It chose to come down to the walkway where we were and we walked all the way to the feeding platform with it so we had a much closer experience which was nice as it is very busy at the platform and you are much further back. I recommend spending as long as possible at the feeding platform, as gradually the crowds start to subside and there is a chance that other orangutans will come along and you'll have a better chance at getting pictures without hundreds of tourists in your way! We waited and a mother and her baby came along, so it does pay off and there are other monkeys around to watch whilst you wait."

If you want to make the most of it, arrive at the time of opening, and once in the park go straight to the nursery. Most visitors will wait in the park around the feeding platform for the feeding that happens at 10 AM. But between 09 AM and 10 AM they feed the younger ones in the nursery. If you come by yourself, this is the best, because you will be there before all the big group of tourists arrive. Only the visitors with guide will go to the nursery because the feeding at the nursery is not advertised. Around 9:45, you can slowly head to the feeding platform to see the bigger ones which will come at this feeding. Actually, we enjoyed more the show at the nursery, because you can observe the younger ones play together and they are not able to see us. At the feeding platform, we only saw one orang utan which was observed by hundreds of tourists taking pictures, this felt a bit pathethic. You may not see many orang utan, but this is the sign that rehabilitation works, and remember that your money is going to a great cause caring about the animals living in the wild."

The healthy adult ones are free to come and go to the forest near by as there's no fence surrounding the centre. All the staff know them by name and by their personality. They are very similar to us. Tip: It's usually very hot in the first feeding and you won't see many orang utan. It's cooler after the 3pm feeding and the curious ones might come close to people to say hi. Stick around until closing time for more chance to see them. It's worth it staying in one of the accommodations (budget or expensive) near the SORC, so you can take your time to explorer other places near by on foot. You can ask your hotel to book a bus to Sukau for about RM 50. They will come to pick you up (or you can book a river cruise tour with them)."

If you are lucky, you can see them when they come to a feeding platform twice a day. Many people are watching. But if you are prepared for this in my view it is an opportunity to see this endagered ape. The rehab centre is a refuge for animal that for some reason can't make it on their own. Though some of the apes are able to get back into the rainforest after training from the professional and caring staff.   "

We stood on a huge wooden platform with half of Malaysia's school children and 100s of other tourists watching a lone orang-utan pick through some fruit. It didn't feel like it was particularly beneficial for the animals and was a cash cow being mercilessly milked masquerading as conservation. The baby orang-utans you are herded to next is better, you watch them from a large air-conditioned auditorium through thick glass which means it affects the animals less, but does make the experience less ""authentic"".

The up side, they receive the very best care and are rehabilitated incredibly successfully.  However many come back to visit.  We saw a mother and her baby at an afternoon feeding time.  Apparently the mother had been an ""inmate"" and had been successfully rehabilitated.  She had mated in the wild and now brings back her baby to show it off to the staff!  We were also told that more than one former ""guest"" drops in to the clinic when they don't feel well, never to be seen again until the next time they are sick.  This is not a zoo and sightings are not to be guaranteed.  Certainly the afternoon feeding time attracts more orang utans than the morning one.  However, should the feeding station not be too populated you can head over to the outdoor nursery where the young ones are taught to swing, climb and above all, keep off the ground.  Only intending to go once probably twice, we found it so entertaining and educating that we altered our schedule to go five times!  You wouldn't be reading this unless you were thinking about going and I know that you will have a truly memorable experience when you do.  If you can afford it, please adopt one.

It was really informative to watch the person who brought the food as he made sure he didn't make eye contact with the young orang-utans as they approached. There is a strict policy to not confuse the orphaned animals so they have a better chance of success when they are eventually released into the wild. Each animal had its own amusing personality. The baby orang-utan training enclosure was fascinating too. These are young animals who have not been raised by their parents so they have to ""learn"" to be an orang-utan."

You get to see orangutans going about their day in the outdoor complex, but the real action occurs when twice a day the center feeds the orangutans.  At that point, any orangutans that want a free meal can stop on by.  The day we were there, the afternoon feeding was far less crowded and the orangutans more animated.  The real show stopper is the nursery where you get to watch the supervised play of the baby orphan orangutans.  This is very well done with the people behind one way glass (and in air conditioning!).  The Center is very well done and I came away a big fan.

2.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 27 August 2015,Friends,"The center itself is supposed to do some valuable work.  If it really happens, we could not judge. Information (apart from ever present ""Adopt an orangutan"" message) are very limited.  If we compare it with the operation in Semmenggoh near Kuching, Sepilok is much less friendly and informative, much more up to your money and we felt its much more of artificial trap on tourist. In fact we loved most of our Borneo Trip, but Sepilok was the worst part of it as they look to be a money trap in the first place.  As for whats happenning in there, we cannot judge the feeding as no orangutans appeared to be fed and after some 30 minutes of waiting with no information at all we were just told to proceed to the nursery. They had a couple of cute small apes in there but you can only watch them through dirty glass (yes, it makes any decent cameras useless and yes, you have to pay for cameras which are not of any use during your visit). And yes, after some 20 minutes of watching, you have to leave the place whatever is happening   The enclosure itself is full of ropes and metal which means even if you could take some serious pictures, most of them would look worse than a couple of quick snaps from your local ZOO. I mean, within an easy reach from our home in Europe there are at least 5 ZOOs with orangutans and in any of them you can get more natural picture of the ape then in Sepilok. We have been travelling around the globe for wildlife for a while but I would recommend to anyone who would like to see the apes going to Kuching instead. Sepilok probably was a great place, but its sadly a distant history now."

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 24 August 2015,Solo,I had always wanted to visit the organutans in the wild and this trip did not disappoint. Wear good shoes as the walkways can be slippy in the humidity. The ticket you get lasts for the entire day but many of the tour groups just do either the morning or the afternoon feeding times and then leave to get buses or planes etc. I decided to stay in nearby Sandakan (not the best place) but a good base for Sepilok and my decision paid off. After all the groups had left I was able to stay with a few remaining tourists and a mother brought her baby down to feed. It was magical and she certainly wouldn't have ventured down to feed while all the crowds were around. A must see if you are visiting Borneo.

Words cannot describe the wonder and humour these adorable creatures provide.  The only sad side is knowing the reason they have to be here.  The keepers are saints as it is obvious the younger ones love to wind them up - like human children.  When you are there, can I put in a plea foir you to pop across the road to visit the Sun Bear Rehabilitation Centre? m These are adorable and are almost as entertaining.."

When we visited one Orang-Utan was very keen on humans, and kept coming on to the human platform, which made for fabulous photos! Staff are knowledgable and friendly, and care deeply for the Orangs'. Facilities are also good - toilets clean, cafe quite delicious.Please note there is a 10 ringgit charge for taking photos - on top of the entry fee. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area!! "

We were lucky to see a good number of Orangutans during both the morning and afternoon feeds and loved gorgeous little ones in the nursery. The morning feed was tour group heavy but we hung around after everyone left and had some very interesting conversations with some of the rangers who were extremely friendly and passionate. We were then lucky enough to have two orangutans climb down from the trees and walk along side us. One of the best days of our trip! Food in the nearby cafe was also fantastic.

Not too busy when we went - but I can imagine what it's like when busy.On our visit an orangutan came up onto our observation deck so we were right next to it. However almost as good (perhaps as good!?) was the night walk the rangers may do if your ask at the front desk. We saw load of animals. Flying squirrels doing 100m glides between trees were amazing. Pit viper snakes. Insects. Scorpions. And of course orangutans if your are lucky.Definitely do the night walk!!

I would have donated or paid more for that experience."

We did however manage to see 3 young Orangutans at the juneville centre, which really got us in the mood to hopefully see some Orangutans in the wild, as we continued our jungle/ river adventure after the visit to Sepilok.This sanctuary plays a very important part in the rehabilitation and re-introduction of captive Orangutans back into the wild. Along with the Sun Bears that they have at sepilok, which is also very well worth visiting.So even though it feels a bit touristy at times, and there is a lot of people all arriving/departing at the same time, as feeding is at stringent times, you have to try and appreciate that your money is being used for a very good cause indeed.All the staff are passionate about the work and care that is being undertaken.Overall i would definately recommend a visit to both the Orangutan and the Sun bear sanctuary."

The guardian said he was very clever and that he approached the people in this way  to get hold of the hats, cameras and other stuff :)We enjoyed the show of this teenager orang for a long while.The feeding attracted a couple more orangs and gave us the possibility of observing them for about 10 minutes....then off they went back to the jungle.The funniest part of all was when we went to the ""open nursery"" (imagine a play ground with different structures equipped with nets, ropes etc.) were the yongest  orangs play together. You may watch them from a big observation room with air conditioning (cooolddd....brrrr) and a wide glass window. That was so funny. There were 3 orangs playing together and their interaction was simply something touching and amazing to see.I could have stayed there for hours.Definitely a wonderful place to visit. I also felt glad for having financed their precious and admirable activities with the entrance fees.The center has also a cafe and a souvenir shop. An instructive movie about orangs is shown at certain times every day (before and after the feedings).Some people complain because they cannot touch the orangs, but we have to remember that the aim of the center is to re-introduce the orangs into the nature. Therefore, the less interaction they have with humans, the best!"

It's worth visiting the nursery (even though you are behind blass) to see the antics of the young ones.

Smart casual as you might expect. It then stopped to bite it's hand and let us take some pictures before a slow clamber into the understory finished one of the most mind blowing minutes of my life. We didn't have especially long, but this experience pushed us to go and watch the afternoon feeding. We weren't disappointed as half a dozen or so including a mother and baby followed the employee with a pack of fruit on his back onto the platform. A very peaceful and beautiful thing to watch. A slight shame about the pig-tailed macaques who joined the party. But go to sepilok, pay the fees, see the animals, and feel your heart warm as you see there is still a bit of hope for Borneo. "

My advice would be wait before or after and sometimes during feeding times not infront of the feeding platform but the edges. (Where most people see them up close) I waited and hour after feeding time by the edge on the feeding platform and was about a foot away from a beautiful orangutan (who tried to grab my camera) it was amazing and I would recommend this park to anyone its beautiful and I will never forget it. key is youve just be patient!"

I am a naturalist who much prefers to see animals in their wild habitat and avoids zoos so was a little concerned about the sanctuary.

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 13 August 2015,Family,"We stayed in the nearby Sepilok Nature Resort and visited the centre twice; once in the morning and again in the afternoon.  In the morning it's much busier because there are more coach parties but the viewing is well managed with a lot of space so you dont really notice the people once the Orang Utans arrive. You can read more on the website, but essentially what you get is Orang Utans that are being taught to be wild again.  They've had their basic training and they are free to go but they know they can get a decent meal twice a day at the feeding platform. These are ""semi-wild"" animals.Apparently we share 96 % of our genes with Orang Utans. Spend a couple of hours at the viewing platform and you can soon see how true this is. We saw two young Orang Utans in the morning and in the afternoon we saw a mother and her baby plus a couple of others too.   The day after there were no sightings in the morning - which goes to show that nothing us guaranteed.The feedings are very well managed with one person arriving quietly and discretely at the feeding platform and spreading out some bananas and leaves. Then you wait for the stars of the show to arrive. Even with 100 people watching, it turns completely silent as we all strain our eyes and ears, waiting for the first Orang Utan to arrive.    The first sign you get is the shaking of a rope, a movement in the leaves, or the sound of something moving in the trees...It felt quite tense!I guess we were about 20 - 30m from the feeding platform. Not too far away, but binoculars are a good idea if you have them.- then you can see all of the facial expressions.  Its probably not cool to give Orang Utans human characteristics but I did just get the sense that some of the beasts were show-boating: playing up to the audience to get a laugh - which they did!There is also a recently opened ""Nursery area"" where you can watch young Orang Utans playing and doing all of the other things that young creatures do.   This is in a separate place from the Feeding platform.The centre show a a film which explains about the work of the centre. Worth watching.In retrospect, this was probably the highlight of our trip.  If you are lucky you may see them in the wild in other parts of Borneo ( we did) but somehow getting close to them in this way was a better experience..."

Next we had to put all our belongings in lockers as nothing (except cameras) can be taken in to the centre as Orang Utans will take things.  We made our way to the feeding platform for 10 am. This was crowded but built so everyone could get a view.  We saw here orangs come to the platform.  Despite the signs clearly asking for silence, a large number of people were chattering, which is possibly why more didn't come.  Next, we went to the outdoor nursery.  This was viewed through glass and the gallery was stepped so everyone could see.  We watched the toddlerss being fed and then playing - they were really entertaining.

We only had a couple of orang-utans come along, but nevertheless it was an experience to behold. The young ones are less shy, perhaps because they cannot see that they are being watched from behind a screen and therefore are more playful.You can start with the babies, before having a look at the adults feeding on the platform, but be aware that you need to arrive early to get a good view.Doors open at 9am and camera permits are MYR10. Bags need to be locked away so as to avoid being lost to the monkeys and orang-utans. It also gets remarkably humid in the jungle so take on lots of fluids before starting the walk in to see the orang-utans. The little shop does coffee, water and basic provisions.

It was honestly worse than a zoo, although I'm glad it means that the rest of the orangutans are free in the wild! But everyone looked really bored, including the orangutan honestly...I loved the outdoor nursery though, but it was definitely like a zoo : tourists watching baby monkeys play through tinted glass!

The rangers are really passionate about their work here and really don't want any Orangs to visit the feeding platform as this means they are thriving in the wild and the rehab programme is successful . Even so it was lovely to watch the adults and a couple of babies whose antics are just so human.

This was great as we didn't t have to rush or be ushered around in a group. In the morning we saw the outdoor nursery and some Orangutans during the feeding including a mum with her baby. In the afternoon it was completely different as one of the youngsters was keen to show off and came up onto the railing of the observation deck and entertained us before being led away by one of the keepers. Later he led a group of us down the decked walkway - completely in charge and adorable. We watched the video about the work done at the centre which was very interesting and informative - don't miss it. We signed up for an adoption to try to help the good work they are doing in a very small way. We also saw the Sun Bears which are also worthy of a visit. It is hit and miss how many you see but just listening to the passionate CEO and founder who is on hand to tell you all about the place was great.

The bus is marked Batu 14 (Sepilok).  The bus returns at 1030, 1230 and 1600.  There were only three people on the bus including us two at 0900 and it was full (with one standee) on the 1600 return, so make sure you're lined up in time for the last bus of the day if you catch it.  The 9am bus arrived at 0940, time enough to buy a ticket (quickly) and walk (quickly) to the platform in time for the first feeding of the day.A ticket here (30 RM for non Malaysians plus 10 RM for a camera) is valid all day, and there are two feeding sessions per day, so hold onto your ticket and return for the MUCH quieter second session at 3pm.The center opens at 9am - 12noon and from 2pm to 4pm.  The feeding sessions are at 10am and 3pm.  There's also a GREAT video screening (9am, 1030, 11am, 12 noon, 2:10pm and 3:30pm) - do yourself a favor and watch this (preferably BEFORE going to the feedings), its incredibly informative and will explain about what you're about to see.  (and the seats are very comfy).There's also an exhibition and display on the Orangutans and the Sumatran Rhinoceros in the same building as the video screening.  Both rooms have incredibly good air conditioning.No bags or water bottles etc are allowed into the feeding area, so you'll need to leave them in lockers (free of charge).  These are in the same building as the video screening (opposite the ticket office), although there are also some lockers at the gate where your ticket is checked en route to the feeding platform.  You'll need to disinfect your hands with the (provided) hand wash on the way to the platform.  You'll need to walk for around 7-10 minutes from the ticket office to get to the feeding platform. There are ""silence"" signs posted at various points and volunteers will try to remind you to be quiet, the Orangutans are unlikely to show up in numbers if there's a hugely noisy group of humans standing around clicking their noisy cameras at them.  Be sure to also visit the outdoor nursery (7 minutes walk further on from the feeding platform) - where you go into a nicely air conditioned building and watch from behind glass as the juveniles play on their playground.  It's much more absorbing than the feeding platform as you'll watch them try to knot and unknot ropes, play fight with each other and make their escape attempts.    The outdoor playground is open until 11am and from 230pm until 4pm.  We were trailed by a family of long tailed macaques on our way to and from the playground (including mother and very small clinging baby).The trail was closed ""until further notice"" when we visited (July 23 2015).

Make sure to head back to the feeding platform before 10am to get a good view. We were lucky to see 3 orangutans and two babies on the feeding platform and there were others about in the surrounding trees. We found that once the orangutans left and the monkeys swept in people got bored and started to leave. However, we stuck around and were lucky to see another young orangutan pass through hanging on the rope and yawning. We decided to walk back to the nursery, but came across a young girl orangutan Ulan playing very close to the boardwalk. It was an amazing experience watching her so close and at one point she swung in towards my boyfriend and put her hand out (we think she liked the look of his camera!). She continued to play and even came down onto the boardwalk railing.

On a trip to Borneo you may be lucky to see one high in the trees or diving past on the road...the pictures are very distant though quite exciting. Here at the sanctuary you get close, particularly at feeding, where orangoutangs swing past walkways which are unfenced, but overseen by rangers, who clearly state you cannot touch. If you are lucky you can get to within 4 feet to take some amazing pictures.Feeding is undertaken on platforms with open viewing galeries...there are 2 feeding a day one at 10am one at 3pm....we went to both....where not just orangoutangs got fed but other monkeys....it was great to watch and observe. There is just as many amusing laughs from the nursery where helpers feed and play with young orangoutangs as part of the rehabilitation. The oversl, experience is focusing on showcasing Asia's great ape but also on the rehabilitation of previously distressed and captured Orangoutangs.There isn't enough to keep you here the whole day...you will need to co bi e with the Sun Bear sanctuary across the road..however it is a must see and we were lucky to get very close to a young orangutang...Overall..unforgettable!"
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 20 July 2015,Couples,"If you are part of a tour group the time allowed for viewing is restricted, particularly in the morning. As example, the sanctuary opens at 9.00AM, watching the introduction and video takes you up to 9.40 - 9.45AM. You will then walk to the feeding platform for 10.00AM. An Orang may not appear till 10.10 or 10.15, the bulk of visitors then move to the outdoor nursery at 10.30 as that closes at 11.00AM. Time is therefore tight to get a fulfilling visit. We stayed at Sepilok which allowed us to visit both AM and PM feeding on two days. The second day visits were so much more enjoyable, we went straight to the outside nursery then back to the feeding platform where we stayed well after 10.30. On one such viewing only one Orang appeared before 10.30 but once the crowd reduced another older Orang appeared, then a mother with a baby. If you come for just one visit you could leave feeling disappointed as animals do not appear on order. In saying this it is well worth visiting and helping the centre to continue caring for Orangs.Toilets and a caf√© are just outside of the entrance office."

The nursery had 3 older babies that were heading to the jungle a lot, which of course is the aim. The 3rd visit had 2 older orang utans that did little but ate some food and then climb off the platform with no swinging at all and only 2 smaller orang utans in the nursery that headed to the jungle fairly quickly. I suppose we had 3 visits to compare and of course they are wild and being rehabilitated but I was very thankful I saw them that first day as it was fantastic.

It's a bit of a drive out of the main town, but you can stay near the centre. We got to see plenty of orangutans and learned a lot about the species and what is being done to help them. An enjoyable and insightful experience."
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 30 June 2015,Couples,"First let me address some of the poor comments which have been left. 1. Glorified/overrated zoo: It is NOT a zoo. That's the entire point peeps.  This is a centre to rehabilitate orangutans. The animals are not there to be a tourist attraction. They are there to be cared for and rehabilitated so that they can be returned to the wild. If you want a zoo, go to a zoo but respect this place for what it is. 2. Too many rules/not a good 'tourist' attraction: See above. Add to that, the rules are there to protect the animals and their visitors not to annoy you. If you understand the reason for the rules you'll find them to be entirely appropriate for the situation. You are a guest in the centre which has a its primary purpose the welfare of the animals, not pandering to spoilt tourists.3. Inconvenient times/not enough to do: The purpose of opening the centre to tourists is generate funds to support the care and rehabilitation of the orangutans. So clearly that needs to fit in around the schedule of the training and care of the animals. Two viewings of feedings plus the outdoor training  centre is well worth  the money.4. Didn't see many orangutans:  They are wild animals not a circus attraction. They don't come to the feeding platform on command. They come if they feel they want/need to. They are not encouraged to do so. In fact they are fed a monotonous but nutritious diet in order to encourage them to forage for themselves (part of their training towards hopefully returning to the wild). During fruiting season when foraging is easier there will be less sightings. The centre makes it clear that sometimes there will be many, sometimes a few and sometimes none at all. That's nature for you. My husband and I were really pleased to see how well run the centre was for the benefit of the animals, rather than being another commercial tourist scheme dressed up as being eco friendly or conservation led. It was a fabulous experience and we have returned several times as a result (and always seen these beautiful creatures)."

To know they are free to come and go as these please is wonderful. The pre-feeding talk and video was inspiring. You HAVE to visit the nursery to watch the babies play and interact - they are so gorgeous! We adopted an orphaned baby Orang Utan for our grandson! A must see place to go!

The young in the nursery area are of course particularly photogenic, and 10.00 o'clock feeding time for the adult was brilliant. Our fantastic guide (from Borneo Adventure) helped ensure not only that our visit was informative, but also that we were in the right places at the right times to have the best chance to see the orang utans -  remember these are wild animals in their natural habitat, so there's no guarantee that they'll appear 'on demand'!"

Feeding time was an awesome experience as leaves and branches started shaking as different Orangutans came to the platform.  Each with their individual characters making the viewing experience all the more entertaining.  Great to see such a wonderful attraction that is based around doing such important and valuable work.  A must see.Don't forget to visit the neighbouring sun bear centre.  adjoins the car park but run separately and with a separate entrance fee.  this facility is in its infancy so the enclosure is smaller (the orangutans  are in the wild rain forest not an enclosure) but their work is equally important and the bears a delight to observe."

We paid, and walked into the park for about a minute and a half, when coming down the walkway toward us was a large adolescent male orangutan! We both massively bottled it and sort of backed up against the rail, and he came right up to us, then hopped up on to the railings and swung away into the trees. So close, that one of the cloud of small bees that follow orangutan around, stung me on the nose! So that's four hours in Borneo and I'd already 'met' an orangutan and been stung by one of his mates! It hurt but wasn't serious thank goodness. A wonderful place where you get up close and personal with these wonderful apes. Hold on to your cameras, as the apes will steal them! The staff are wonderful too and do great work at rehabilitating them and getting them released where appropriate. Loved it. You must go!"

That being said all the trails were closed inside which was my main motivation for visiting, and the nearby rainforest walk has a separate admission fee.  We saw two Orangutans, a few Macaques, and visited the young Orangutans.  Nice day all in all, but a bit expensive considering all the trails were closed and there is no warning regarding that."
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 23 June 2015,Couples,Great that we saw just one young ape at the feeding station on our first visit as that I thought confirmed independence. Saw plenty females with their babies on the second viewing when we also noticed wild hierarchical behaviour. Outdoor nursery was fun also. Disappointed that I was charged as a non Malaysian 600% more than a Malaysian but I think that is widespread practice. Not the same as a wild sighting - it can't be - but a great 5 star experience.

For the feeds orangs were waiting around for about 30 mins before the man to came with the bananas, so it is worth getting their early. Of the two feeding times the afternoon was probably the better experience for us as two female orangs were there with their babies the whole time. Other orangs also arrived but once they had helped themselves with the fruit took themselves back to the jungle, with their stash in hand. There was also a lot of monkeys about eatnig fruit and also causing a disturbance. There was also more junior orangs visiting the outdoor nursery in the afternoon. The night walk which we booked directly through the centre was also an interesting experience, made more special by the enthusiasm of James, our guide, from the centre who clearly loves his work. We saw an eagle, a flying squirrel, a pigmy squirrel, snake and several insects during this visit."

As you pull into the car park this feels very much more like a zoo / safari park and there are a lot more people. We saw only 2 younger orang-utan at the feeding station, plus some in the nursery through glass, and it felt very much a man made environment.If you can only get to this sanctuary then it is obviously worth a visit to see them at close quarters."
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 16 June 2015,Friends,"The feeding sessions are on twice a day and advised that you attend both sessions to capture these great primates. You need to be patient when going into the sanctuary during feeding sessions as the orangutans are shy of people and don't come out all at once. It took a good 20 minutes before the orangutans started to come out, by then many people had left...but it is worth the wait as these animals are camera and people shy and tend to come out when there are less people.

2.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 15 June 2015,Solo,"First let me say this - I respect and value the work they're doing to help the Orangutans. That good work however doesn't make a good tourist experience.Their operating hours are poorly designed - you have to leave immediately after morning feeding with no time to visit the trails (which were closed anyway). And they don't reopen for 3 hours, leaving you with nothing to do but sit around waiting. Inside you can't bring any backpacks or bags, so forget carrying extra camera lenses for photography. Despite the heat and humidity, you're also not allowed to carry any water, which is a very real health risk (no water is available inside either). Want to take a picture? You'll have to pay for EACH camera you bring in. The feeders also make no effort to feed the Orangutans in a way which will provide you a good view - they feed them facing their backs to you, or from the furthest platforms away. The juveniles are only viewed from behind indoor rooms with dirty glass that have sunlight glaring in on them.Again - they're doing great things for the Orangutans, but they've done what appears to be absolutely nothing to provide a good visitor experience. If you've seen them at a zoo, you've seen the same thing you'll get here. Go see them on a real wildlife tour, it's much more rewarding."

Make sure you plan your arrival around the feeding time, there weren't any orangutans to see before they brought out the food, but afterward a few came around. One even came up on the boardwalk!It is kind of a bummer that they charge you extra to take your camera in -- (+RM10), who is going to go there without a camera? Also note that they don't allow any food or water in the park (the orangutans can get a hold of it), so make sure you are well hydrated prior to your visit. If you get too hot, make your way to the young orangutan complex, they have aircon. "
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 13 June 2015,Couples,We visited the Sepilok Orangutan Sanctuary for four feeding sessions over three days. On each occasion we were fortunate to see a number of Orangutans come to the platform to feed.  We also visited the outdoor nursery and saw several youngsters playing on each occasion. We ventured part way down the bird trail but did not see any birds and the terrain was very uneven at times. On one return from the nursery we encountered a troop of Macaques with two very aggressive males. We were forced to return to the Rangers hut and eventually he escorted us and other guests out. So it is worth reminding you that this is the jungle and you need to be careful at all times. Despite this encounter it was well worth visiting. We also did a night walk where we saw a flying squirrel as well as various insects and lizards.Tip:  It is worth visiting several feeding sessions if you want to be sure of seeing Orangutans as there is no guarantee that they will appear.

At the entrance, you are asked to lock up your bag, and reduce items of value being snatched by other monkeys, although we did not see this. The main viewing area has rows of seats, and a glass panel in front. At feeding time , the orangs bound in or swing skilfully on beaches or the supplied ropes.Bananas is what they want, although in the wild , they go nuts about the king fruit, Durians.As a sanctuary, the orangs on show, and I counted 6 were young.I suppose part of the deal is that human interaction is kept minimal."

They explain how the entire process go for these primates to be reahbilitated, how they find them, where they come from, how much time they spend there and when they can be released again. The area where the animals are is huge, and there is only one feeding point where they can come to get food and that is the moment when you can see them if they come. The idea is that they start finding food on their own out in the reservation and once they stop coming to get food for a couple years then they release them. I was very happy to see that there is very limited interaction with humans, and there are no cages or closed spaces, really interesting to see how a center like this works, and yes, the orangutans where super cute!"

There is a real attention seeking orang utan who comes down and poses around the tourists (there is a keeper there keeping tourists away from this guy).

The feeding platform isn‚Äôt really there to feed them, it is more to discourage them from there and find their own food around the sanctuary. That‚Äôs why they feed them Bananas, because they are mundane food for them. So, if none turn up to the feeding platform it‚Äôs a good sign. But not for the tourists. There is also an outdoor nursery which the younger ones turn up to and interact with each other. They are an animal that I could watch for hours without getting bored. The sanctuary does close for a couple of hours so we popped over to the Sun Bear sanctuary and had lunch as there is a caf√© there. Once it reopened we went back inside and watched them all over again. They do roam free as well as we saw one around the ticket office and apparently they pop over to the Sun Bear Sanctuary as well. You do have to pay for the privilege of using your camera though. 10 Ringgits per camera. All proceeds do go to upkeep of the sanctuary. I would say it‚Äôs well worth the visit if you are in Borneo.

You can go and see orangutans that are being rehabilitated so that they can be released into the wild. The orangutans that are old enough to leave the nursery get to go and play in the jungle gym which visitors can watch from inside a viewing room. At 10am and 3pm you can watch, the successfully rehabilitated orangutans get fed. I watched three feeding times, all of them being different. In the first feeding session there was three adults and one had a baby, all of them were climbing around, eating and playing with each other. In the second feeding there were two mothers and baby's, this time they were generally less active, more interested in feeding than anything else. In the third feeding only one orangutan turned up, had a little food then had a nap. All session were great to see and the orangutans never seemed bothered by or interested in the small crowd of people watching them. I had a great experience when the centre first opened an orangutan was walking along the path way in front of me, occasionally stopping to watch me or to pick something up to investigate it. This was probably the best thing that I was in Borneo!One ticket is 30rm them an extra 10rm if you want to bring a camera with you which is well worth it. The ticket allows you into the trails for the whole day so both feeding sessions and access to the walking trails. But the walking trails are currently closed and there is no information as to when or if they will reopen which is a shame.

Saw around 15 orangs in total, even got close up to one on a trail, plus tons macaques who never seemed phased by us. Those that are comparing this place to a zoo are visiting Sepilok for the wrong reasons. It is a rehabilitation centre set next to a rainforest for wild and semi wild orangutans to treat and help them back into the wild. Not a zoo where you can see animals on demand Or touch them. Obviously those complaining are  just there see the animals as entertainment and don't have their best interest at heart!"

After that you will have the chance to see the orang utan during their feeding time at 10 am. They will be fed with the same fruits twice a day with the aim that these orang utan will be bored of the foods provided and started looking for other fruits in the jungle on their own."

It is very big and you are likely to see many orang-utans at the feeding times - you could spend hours there but you can't, again for trying to keep the orang-utans as 'wild' as possible. We did however book at the Sepilok centre, a private night tour which I would highly recommend and we were fortunate enough that one of the orang-utans came walking by us near the centre - very close, maybe 5m maximum - it was great! They are not locked into the centre and freely roam about over a wide area (100's of acres).

Arrive early and head towards the nursery area first as the youngsters can give you some amazing photo opportunities especially when the bulk of the visitors have yet to arrive.  I was fortunate enough to have a cheeky orangutan walk onto the boardwalk and cross it within touching distance of us. He was escorted away with a scowl on his face and is known as 'the naughty one.'. The nursery area is enclosed and a little cooler. You can observe the orangutans without them seeing you and they are comical.until feeding time when they grab as much watermelon as they can followed by banana. Another feeding of the older animals takes place half an hour later outdoors in the jungle. My tip is to ignore the hustle bustle of the crowds and just focus on your reason for being there as it is a once in a lifetime experience.

Also since end of 2014 you can visit the nursery - observe from a viewing room I suggest to do that before or after the feeding time, to benefit the most. There is also a tracking path (9 AM to 2 PM), and video about the project 5 times a day.

They do still live in the wild and if you are planning a trip you may get lucky in the rain forest. If not then this is the next best thing. A very good introduction explains the system of healing and reintegrating these animals into the wild. Feeding times are the best time to see Orang Utans as they come down to the platforms for food. There is also a nursery for the young to feed and play. Unfortunately it rained for our visit so not so many came down however we were treated to a display of 'make an umbrella out of palm leaves' a trick that they have learned from watching the visitors!

It's not advertised but the centre does have an orangutan nursery which is worth a visit too.  Each time we stayed right through until closing time at 4pm, when majority of visitors had left but this is a great time for orangutan surprises eg one walking less than two feet away beside us, a mummy and baby posing in a tree close by....An incredible experience at a very fair price of less than ¬£7 entry each.

They have lots of room to move about, and it would probably be hard to see them if you're not going at feeding time. We went to the morning feeding, and I recommend getting to the feeding platform about 15 min before so that you have a good view. You can visit the nursery afterwards, but they do close up around 11am. There are other trails to walk along in the reserve. It is nice that they seem to have their space, and I was happy to read that about 66% of the orang utans are successfully released back into the wild."

Its nice to know that the centre is open ended to the wild rain-forest and orangutans are free to come and go as they please even when they have been fully released back into the wild, some come back occasionally for a feed and even bring their new youngsters as they know it is a safe place to come to.Excellent centre full of knowledge.

We had already spent 5 nights at the Rasa Ria hotel and seen their 2 orang-utans in a very crowded small area.  I had read varying reviews so was prepared not to see much.  You aren't allowed a bag in the reserve area (free lockers) so you get very very hot waiting around if you arrive early (recommended).  Centre opened at 9am.  Drink water beforehand.  We saw an orang-utan walking along the walkway on the way to the feeding area before more people arrived.  Our tour guide was very keen to take us to the nursery beforehand but we declined as it said it was a 10 minute walk and we wanted to get a good viewing spot.  We did get a prime spot at the front, there were quite a lot of people but not as crowded as at the Rasa Ria hotel as more space.  We went twice for viewings (it is free to visit again on the same day but unfortunately we couldn't do this so did the afternoon first and the following morning). They were different experiences as to be expected.  The first one we saw about 5 orang-utans coming swinging along to get the food and leaving again.    It's great to see them appearing and disappearing into the trees.  As the crowds mostly had then gone another came along carrying a baby so don't rush off too early, it pays to arrive early and wait around after all this is why you have come.  The 2nd day in the morning it looked fine but absolutely poured down with rain as we waited for the feeding to start.  A cheeky young orang-utan decided he didn't like the rain either and sheltered where the people were sheltering and was showing off and making the crowd run all over the place as the reserve staff try and keep tourists back.  It was very entertaining and very wet!!  As you can't bring bags we didn't have our ponchos with us so had to change afterwards we were so wet.  There is some cover but the whole crowd was trying to get under it including the orang utan.  No orang-utans came to the feeding platform whilst it was raining.  Suggest bringing ponchos and going back to get them if it rains or bring an umbrella (they allow those).  After the rain stopped a lot of tourists had to move on as the tours were moving on but we had walked from our accommodation so stayed longer and saw 4 other orangutans coming to get their food.  The nursery was nice but just like looking at a zoo enclosure and the babies weren't that little.  It was less than 10 mins to walk - more like 5.  We also saw a leech after the rain but not on the path!  A good experience, not too expensive, for a good cause and good little caf√© outside."

It was truly magnificent to see that the people working here are really helping these wonderful creatures get back into the life they should know! It was great to know that some of the orangutans actually have moved on with their lives in their natural surroundings! If you do get a chance to visit, I say go for it! Be warned that it isn't a guarantee that you will be able to see the orangutans come out for a meal!

I can echo all the great things others have said, but instead will pass on some information I was looking for while planning my trip. 1) There are clean modern western flush toilets at the site.They do not close 2) There is a restaurant that serve's tasty hot inexpensive meals at the site. 3) You are supplied locks and keys at the free lockers at the site. The normal sized lockers will hold a backpack, and they have larger ones if needed. There is someone there to give keys etc. so lockers are monitored so you do not have to worry about theft. 4) Get to the feeding station twenty minutes early and you can pick a prime viewing spot. 5) There is a basic gift shop at site. 7) There are trails to hike in between feeding times. 8) There is a Sun Bear Sanctuary on the other side of the parking lot.There is a lot of things to do that can easily fill a day. You can buy water, snacks, lunch, ice cream at restaurant Don't miss walking and seeing the Orangutan nursery. Hike the trails (you are in the sanctuary, it's safe and you may see more orangutans) or go see the Sun Bears. Fall in love and adopt one of these amazing creatures before you leave. Even if you are going to a river lodge and Sepilock is a stop on the tour, it is well worth adding an extra day to your trip and spending it here, as the short time you are here with the tour is not enough. We were sure glad we did."

Then there's a short feeding time when a keeper puts a bucket of fruit on a platform and orang utangs and macaques may come out of the sanctuary forest to eat for a few minutes.  There may be none or perhaps 4-5 but probably no more.  You would see exactly the same in any modern, well kept zoo."

We were barely 2 minutes in the sanctuary before we were met by 2 Orangutans which walked us all the way to their feeding platform. There we saw a mother and baby and another male who spent around an hour very close up posing for the tourists to take pictures. According to the guides, he does it often and loves the attention. Apparently he's very naughty and occasionally tries to snatch things from tourists who get a bit too close!After a few hours watching them play and eat, we then went to watch the informative video which was very interesting. We had a break for lunch and came back in the afternoon to watch the young ones play in the outdoor nursery. Seeing an Orangutan like that was magical and we had an amazing day watching these fascinating animals. I know we got lucky to see so many so close as nature doesn't stick to a schedule, but it's still a good cause to donate to for the chance of having an experience as incredible as ours!"

We did see a reasonable amount of macaque though.  And there were 2 baby apes in the rescue house.  We weren't allowed to take water in with us and they provide none. Considering the risk level to humans their policy is daft. The centre is apparently owned by the government.  The explanation given for lack of apes is that they have bought tracts of jungle for the apes to live in. That sounds good news until you realise the government must lease out jungle for palm oil production in the first place!  Which was why the apes were exploited and need preservation. 
3.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 9 April 2015,Couples,"Like Craig in an earlier review I feel that the priority of SORC is more about tourism, rather than education and conservation. SORC has a rare opportunity to educate people about orang-utans in a semi-natural setting.   The website doesn't tell you that the feeding areas are ""off limits"" at all other times besides between the assigned open times for feedings, whether orangutans are there or not.  Its probably because some tourists just don't have any regard or understanding for space from the animals. One should NOT approach an orang-utan on the boardwalk, getting as close as possible and try to touch the animals.  They ARE wild.  I understand that the centre can not exactly prevent this from happening, but I feel that there should be more efforts to discourage it, and explain to people how it is counter-productive to their rehabilitation efforts.  Between feeding times only the nature bird trail walk and beyond is open, which is a nice hike but no guaranteed sightings.   The pricing for ""non feeding times"" should be adjusted accordingly.  Camera fees are ridiculous....why not just increase the price more...everyone has a phone camera.  The new Borneo Sun Bear Conservation Center may be a good visit next door."

The afternoon is much quieter than the morning and the longer you can hang around after the feed the more likely you will see the orang-utans wandering closer to the paths. A visit to the nursery is a must. If you can go more than once even better - we went morning and afternoon on 2 different days and had quite different experiences.

Personally i dont think its worth the time or money considering i only saw 2 orangutans. Considering this is probably the biggest drawcard for Borneo tourism i was expecting a lot more.

Finally we made it to the platform for the morning feed - yes the babies are very cute.. what was missing was information or a discussion of how many animals have been returned to the wild, or how many animals are rescued, survivorship, habitat threat abatement etc.. compared with the nearby sun bear conservation centre which has far less resources but is full of information and informed personnel - this Orangutan centre was a disappointment.  Staff at the baggage locker area are unhelpful - several lockers have the same number (but unique keys) - but you are left to work it out while staff hang out with their friends and play on their phones.

After a first look at the young sun-bears they have in their care, we went deeper into the forest to the orang feeding station. Here young orang-utans, rescued from captivity, are being trained to survive in wild forest once again. Our visit was timed to see their feeding ritual, where fruit is provided at a wooden platform, connected by stout ropes to the neighbouring trees.This way the orangs learn to climb, swing and move naturally to receive food supplements. It was a delight to watch two individuals quietly feeding on fruit, until some more pushy individuals arrived and started to plunder their banana hoard. Their long arms and ability to grip with both hands and feet makes them superbly agile among the trees and lianas of the forest. We could have stayed all day, but the sight of these remarkable apes learning to live in the forest from which they had been stolen was unforgettable. There may be fewer than 50,000 animals left in Sumatra and Borneo, their numbers dwindling every year as rain forest is felled to create palm-oil plantations."

Best time to go is for the morning feeding as you'll get to see more of the orang utans. Take time to also watch the video which will give you better insight into the quite primate and rehabilitations efforts at the centre. There is also a bonus as you also has a chance to get up close with the rare & cute Malaya bear - The Sun Bear which is adjacent to the Orang Utan sanctuary.

I watched both feedings and saw a few orangutans each time. One of the staff members explained that there are 46 semi-wild orangs (forgive me if that number is wrong) that come for the feedings - therefore, many of them do not come everyday - they find their own food in the surrounding forest which is about 45km^2. In other words, Sepilok is not a zoo, as many people tend to see it. I believe they are truly helping the orangutans. With that being said, I WAS a little put-off by all the tourists bombarding one bold orangutan who came quite close. I think the staff should at least control the crowds a bit better, and even more drastically, I think photography should be forbidden, because so many people just care about the perfect shot; they don't care how the orangutan feels about having 30+ cameras shoved in his face. All in all though, it's a really fantastic experience, and you're sure to see at least a couple orangs, if not many. "

I have been visiting it since I was a little girl and have a love and interest in wildlife especially Orangutans, the group we have at the centre are from  Sumatra. I saw a documentary on the Sepilok Rehabilitation centre and promised myself I would visit one day to see the centre and experience seeing Orangutans in their natural environment. We stayed at the Rasa Ria Resort in Kota Kinabalu so that we could visit the Rehabilitation centre there and understand the complete process of rescue to wild. We took an internal flight to Sandakan (which we booked ourselves) with Malaysian Airways and booked a guide and transfers with Inno Travel & Tour Services. The two guides we had throughout the day were fantastic, they were passionate about the conservation programme but allowed us free time to sit at the feeding station and wait til the other tours had moved away, this enabled us to experience the rainforest , the atmosphere, noises and other animals & birds. We had booked both morning and afternoon feeding sessions with visit to the Sunbear conservation area with very close by. Both sessions included a visit to the nursery area, for us this was a little disappointing as it feels like being in a Zoo, you are taken to an inside viewing gallery, the glass is very dirty and it makes it difficult to take photos. The younger Orangutans play and feed on platforms and ropes and although I understand the necessity to keep humans at distance it is a shame that the design of the area is not outside and more natural in keeping with the area. The morning sessions at the main feeding platform was quite busy but it is well worth hanging around until it is quieter. The afternoon session was better and we were lucky enough when walking quietly to see a young male very close to us, he moved into a tree right in front of me, a moment I will never forget !

We also went back in the afternoon (one ticket is for the whole day) but saw only 2 Orangutans, so the morning seems to be the best time to go.However, if you are paying for this as part of a tour all the way from KK then I think the tour companies charge way too much for it.

Here's an overview of what to expect. You'll be led down a wooden walkway in large group of 40-50 tourists until you reach a viewing area which is located in the Jungle about 5 minutes walk away. There's a raised Orangutan feeding platform around 30 Meters away from the viewing area ,which has ropes leading to it from several angles. The idea being that Orangutan's will swing over to the platform when it's feeding/treat time. On the occasion we visited the group of tourists was a mix of adults, rowdy school children (on an school outing) and two selfish travelers with crying babies, which unsurprisingly were quite distressed in 40+ Degrees, 100% humidity and no shade. Despite the best (slight lacking) efforts of the staff to try and quiet people down, the consequence of all this noise was it scared off the ""wild"" Orangutan's. However the staff have a good plan for occasions like this and after 15 minutes or so a staff member climbed up to the viewing platform with a baby Orangutan clinging to his back (awwww). With the remaining time the staff member encouraged the baby Orangutan to eat and a couple of small opportunistic primates turned up too. An older ""wild"" Orangutan swung in for a few minutes (hurrah) and grabbed some treats and interacted with the baby, then swung off into the Jungle. So after a shaky start to the visit, we did manage to see a couple of Orangutan's.Summary, if you are planning to visit the Sepilok Rehab Centre, id recommend you take a decent zoom lens for your camera, its the only way you be able to see the Orangutan's up close. The feeding platform is too far away to have a decent memorable view. Also you might want to consider packing some duct tape just in case there's a school trip and a nice down pillow to quietly smother any selfish parents that cruelty bring babies to the viewing area. Also ensure that you aren't just travelling to Borneo for the sole purpose of visiting the Rehab Centre, you'll be disappointed and will be missing what Borneo really has to offer."

The 'naughty' orangutan jumped on to a lady and ripped her clothes when we were there, no Rangers were around to help! They seem to get a lot of human interaction at the centre and can be dangerous to us who aren't trained. Definitely worth going to, they have a lot of forest to live in which is good.

Orphaned orangutans are cared for and raised and then are free to come and go in the wider rainforest as they please.  For entertainment's sake alone the nursery is worth visiting to watch the toddlers learning to play on the ropes swings etc.  Watching the feeding of those who feel the need (in our case two mothers with newborns) is wonderful.  There are also other animals such as the ever present macaques black squirrels, birds, lizards etc.  Do not expect a petting zoo but it is a great opportunity to learn about our nearest cousins and to get great photos. We allowed three days to ensure that we did and it was well worth it.  On the last day there was only one juvenile turn up for the morning feed and the people who came only that morning missed out on some of the better sightings.  There is an additional per camera charge that wasn't present 10 years ago when we were last there which initially felt a bit of a rip-off, but all money goes to the sanctuary so well worth it."

We saw giant flying squirrels gliding from tree to tree, some sleeping birds, several giant spiders and not one but four tree pit vipers, ranging from 2 babies to a mid size to a big one.  Snakes aren't easy to see, so we were lucky.The daytime feeding was a bit disappointing.  Only one turned up in the morning and didn't stay long as the macaques harassed him (or her).  We found out later that the afternoon feeding is usually more productive.Be sure to watch the informative video.The cafe serves perfectly adequate food (we had burgers).We had some trouble getting a taxi after our visit because the facility is closed for a couple of hours after noon and because we'd stopped for lunch, we were looking for a taxi in the dead time.  We also had trouble after our night walk because the walk went on longer than advertised so our booked taxi had got tired of waiting and left.

There is no guarantee any will turn up, so if they don't it means they are achieving their goal. The entrance fee allows you in all day so you can see both feelings. We went independently and most tours are there in the morning, so we had the Orangutangs almost to ourselves in the afternoon. It is possible if you are short of time to see the morning feed, cross the road to the sun bears (again not a zoo) and go back for the afternoon feed.

The forest pathways are the best parts to explore because after a couple of hours communing with the orphaned orangutans you can go off and explore on your own.

We had the benefit of our tour guide who told us exactly where to go and what to expect but nothing really prepared us for the arrival of the first orangutans. You could hear them before they came into view, it was a bit like waiting for King Kong  to come crashing through the trees!  I couldn't beleive my eyes when I saw the first apes arrive.  They were all so different; little skinny ones; broad hairy ones - we even saw a mother clutching her dead infant. I liked the fact we weren't intruding on them at all, the feeding platform was a safe distance away.  It is very difficult to spot Orangutans in the wild so this was the next best thing.  These recently-released Orangs are fed to make sure they get enough food until they start to fend for themeselves. Some of them never adapt especially those who have been particulalry mistreated prior to being saved. This is why this centre is so invaluable, they monitor and re-home the ones who cannot survive in the wild. You can follow their progress through the UK based charity partner Orangutan Appeal UK.  it was devastating to see the depleted rain forests but I did feel the people of Borneo are trying to  save their wildlife and environment. In fact, what Iloved most about Borneo was how human habitats were entwinned with nature; everywhere you went there was some sort of creature flying by or climbing up the walls or croaking outside your bedroom window. So if you go to Borneo, your trip wont be complete without a visit to Sepilok Orangutan Rehab Centre."

I think it was because there are road works at the moment. Cost to get in was 30 MR for adults and 15 MR per child with an additional 10 MR to take a camera in.There were 2 mothers with babies and they put on a good show for us, then once they left we went to the nursery till it closed at 11am. It was worth waiting there for a while as they're put back in cages at 11 and it was fun to see the keepers call for them and see them come out of the jungle in response, hold hands with the keeper and return inside.Our kids didn't want to stay around so they caught the 12pm bus back to town while we walked the bird trail. It was quite muddy so they were only allowing people with closed shoes to go and it was a decent walk. We got very hot and sweaty but there was no one else around and it was nice to experience the jungle quietly. We came across a big group of long tailed macaques and spent some time watching them and also encountered a Provost squirrel but no birds....Lunch in the cafe just outside was very good and value for money. We also watched the video which was interesting and then decided to visit the Sun Bears while we waited for the 3pm feeding. On our way across the car park we were surprised by a juvenile orangatang who was hanging around closely watched by an official who grabbed him and led him back off to the jungle when he started to get a bit close to the people.The two mothers with babies returned for the 3pm feeding along with a younger male then we caught the 4pm bus back to town.The sanctuary is well worth supporting. Everyone there is committed to doing things the right way with everything geared towards enabling the animals to be rehabilitated to the wild rather than the animals being seen as a commodity to attract tourists."

There are no boundaries or pens, the orangutans have the entire rainforest to explore and come to the viewing platform because they want to, not because they are made to.

Also one cheeky monkey and a black squirrel. There is no guarantee you will see any animals at all, as the Orangutang are free in the reserve and in fact encouraged to search for their own food.If you are on your own, let the tourists on tours leave, wait behind and see if any more Orangutang arrive, this was when the male came to feed, there were only about 10 people left when he showed. He was magnicent to watch.In the afternoon we came back to see the open nursery, this is where the baby Orangutang learn to swing on ropes, feed themselves etc. was wonderful to watch.

Even though it is a rehabilitation place for orangutans that have been left parentless, or abused by the natives, it is still a place where they 'fly' from tree to tree and assemble for their feedings. As the feeding time approaches, you can hear rustling in the trees, far above, and look up and see the descent from tree to tree to the communal feeding place. Asked not to touch the orangutans for reasons including spreading disease or contracting it, they come within inches of you, focusing on getting their next meal. The staff if great informing the visitors of the animals, history of how and why many are there, and ways to support, and 'adopt' a baby orangutan, so as to assist with feeding and medical care. The organization sends current pictures of your adoptee along with progress and information on how your orangutan is doing. Very informative and educational."

After the film show we decided to look at the bear sanctuary which is opposite we enjoyed that but you don't need much time there in our opinion as the enclosure is close to the viewpoint so you can see bears quite well.

But it was very difficult to see at times due to the number of people there, and also difficult to take photos due to us being in a glass fronted building with lots of reflections.  We then walked to the feeding viewing station and were very fortunate in that an orangutan led us by walking on the handrail all the way to the viewing area!   Our own personal tour guide!! Only a couple of orangutans turned up for feeding that morning and they were quite a distance away so I was pleased I had my binoculars with me.  We watched the film back at the visitor centre, and made purchases at the gift shop, but I was surprised that more effort wasn't made to encourage us to donate to this very worthy cause.

The Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre is one of the centres focussed on rehabilitating these amazing animals with a view to them returning to the wild (or as close to it as they can get). There's a nursery with a viewing platform, where we were lucky enough to see one of the youngsters being fed (as well as seeing some cheeky black squirrels who were, true to form, squirrelling away some of the orangutan food). There are two feeding sessions a day for the 'main platform' 10am and 3pm. We were lucky enough, according to one of the volunteers at the centre, to see 6 orangutans come in for a feed (including a mother and baby). We were told it's rare to see more than that in a feeding session - the volunteer said that 8 is about the maximum you'll see at any one time. On our walk back to the entrance, we were extraordinarily lucky to see another volunteer walking along with two juvenile (and obviously very tame) orangutans on the walkway's handrail - we gave the orangs room to pass by, but they were only an arm's length away. Truly breathtaking!!Highly recommend a visit - plan to spend half a day (morning or afternoon)."

I took the trail to the bird tower and this is worth doing.  Be careful!!!!  Do Not take the wooden steps down. This is another trail that ends in a dead end.  It does not, as I thought, loop back. You must retrace your steps. Beware leeches as I had 12 on me with 5 drawing their fill....yuk! Worth going to for sure.  You may be lucky and see lots of these wonderful creatures.

I read at the Sanctuary that ""if you don't see that many Orang Utan around, it means that they can already find their own food in the forest"". I would say that it means they are successful in a way, but it might be disappointing for some that wish to see more at the Sanctuary. The video is good, but the room itself is a bit run down. If only their can make it like a theater, it might be more interesting for people to visits and see the video itself. The exhibition is also just so-so, not that impressive or no impact at all."

There are far fewer people and the orang utan are I see there were negative comments from some visitors about the staff and the way it is organised. It is worth remembering that the apes are all wild - and so staff there are watching constantly the behaviour of the apes to keep visitors safe, so they can't always answer all questions in detail at the time but they will do at the end. And the behaviour of many tourists - talking loudly, phones ringing and children running around for example can make their job hard.

It's a good sign when this happens as it shows that the apes have managed to forage food for themselves independently in the jungle. Sometimes a macaque or two will show up during feeding time as well to share the spoils. There's also an outdoor nursery where young orangutans can frolic in the outdoor 'playground' designed to hone their natural athletic abilities. I spotted a couple of apes there and it was a joy seeing one of them playing with the rubber tires. And if you want more information about these playful yet solitary creatures, there's an exhibition room that you can happily spend at least half an hour in.It was a pleasure seeing the apes roaming freely and joyfully at this shady forest of a sanctuary and heartwarming to note that something positive is being done to rehabilitate them when they are rescued - often as orphans."

So sad...

You couldn't get close and personal with the orangutans which i liked- you could tell it was a sanctuary and not a zoo. I also really enjoyed the presentation, it was really educational of the issues surrounding orangutans in the wild. "
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 16 November 2014,Couples,"Don't expect the centre to be like a zoo where the animals are strategically ""set up"" for public viewing - this is a research and rehabilitation centre where simply the feeding times are made a public attraction, but everything else is set up for the well-being of getting Orangutans back into the wild. Other than viewing the feeding and having a look at the nursery, there is not much to do here - like I said, it's not a zoo! We were lucky to see quite a few Orangutans during the feeding time and it is quite something else to realize that they have no fence cutting them off from their life in the wild when they are ready! The efforts at Sepilok are much appreciated and hopefully will continue to be successful!"

This is the third time I have been here and have never failed to be impressed by these fascinating creatures.

The babies are trained step by step for around 5years to learn to fend for themselves before being freed into the jungle. Even then, they are not left entirely as feeding stations are set up for them to come to until finally they, of their own accord, go off to be totally independent. A very moving and thought provoking experience, well worth a visit."

According to the people working there, it was fruit season and the monkeys could get more variety and great quantity of fruits inside the forest, therefore they didn't come out. Only the orang utans came to show face to the tourists. :pI did have a very close view of the orang utans after I left the feeding place. It was walking on the side of our path right when we turned the corner. I had seen them on the bridge more than once during my multiple times of visit. So make sure you walk slowly when you are about to leave the feeding platform, and keep an eye on the nearby surroundings."

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 9 November 2014,Couples,"Imagine that you walk onto a wooden catwalk raised some 50 inches above the jungle surface. Unmated vegetation and lianas  make up sort of a green corridor, from which only the very high trees stand out. Here and there the catwalk becomes a large multilayered platform. At those points the staff place food. Up to their moment the jungle seemed only inhabited by birds and insects, when suddenly, little by little, the first orangutans get out of the wilderness , run along the lianas and - before you realize - entire tribes of these big monkeys are there to start the show. It is absolutely marvelous. But, if you succeed in avoiding the usual crowds, then it happens the miracle: you are alone, and the noises become strong, the wilderness is alive and close to you, and... without the minimum perception on your part, a young orangutan is walking on the wooden handrail of the catwalk. just by side to you. At first it seems not to care about you, next he places one of his hands on your shoulder, and believe me, this gives you sort of a primaeval thrill, this is not a BBC documentary, you and him you are there for real... Mamma mia! But soon someone is approaching on the catwalk, and the beast disappears in the greenery again as it came by. I highly recommend this visit I will nbever forget. Just try to choose an hour when there are a few visitors, crowds would certainly spoil your pleasure."

While we appreciate the rehabilitation effort going on, for us it was extremely disappointed and a waste to time. We had much better and closer experiences with Orangutans in the jungles of Sabah."
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 7 November 2014,Couples,A very organised centre with strict rules regarding what you can bring into the park. There were only about six orang-utans there when we visited but the mother with the baby stole the show. Lots of people there so it is hard to get a good view for photo taking and you do have to pay for a camera to go in!

"
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 7 November 2014,,"We had a short morning to visit the orangutan, it is a wonderful opportunity for education and a good place to rehabilitate and protect orangutans who have no chance in the wild. However we would have enjoyed more time to appreciate the centre and watch the orangutan, very touristic and we were shepherded from the feeding platform to the nursery and then out.  When we first arrived we saw a pair in a tree and would have loved to have watched more behaviour like that but we wanted to see the rest not knowing we couldn't go back."
3.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 6 November 2014,Couples,The work the people involved with the sanctuary is incredible and hats off to the staff and the people behind the centre who have rescued and rehabilitated so many orang-utans.HOWEVER as much as everyone loves these human like apes the crowds appear to be enormous now. The orangutans come twice a day for feeding (9:30am and 3:30pm).  It borders on the lines of a circus act which is a little uncomfortable viewing with very loud and distressing crowds.  Definitely check out the RDC up the road for a more comfortable experience with nature with the possibility of spotting an orangutan.
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 6 November 2014,Solo,Attended the afternoon feeding session and saw 5 orangutans at the outdoor viewing and another 5 orangutans at the indoor viewing area.  It's a good experience but I preferred the viewing platform at rasa ria.
3.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 6 November 2014,Couples,"I have volunteered with Orangutans in the past and I don't like seeing the animals lured towards tourists using food. Yes you will get to see Orangutans, but only because they are becoming tamer and getting used to being around humans. This makes it harder for them to survive in the wild as they pick up bad habits and lose their fear of humans. If you just want to see an Orangutan then by all means go along, but there are other options."
2.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 5 November 2014,Family,"we visited the Sepilok sanctuary first and heard it wasn't worth visiting which it wasn't, and read an article written by the Sunday Times Travel section that this was the best sanctuary in Borneo to see Orangutans, well the writer of this article couldn't have been more wrong, conservation on a money maker is what it appears. The video that you watch before you see them appears to be about 10 years old and  appears to have been staged, we then go and see 3 Apes , well it was like a Zoo and for me it was conservation at its worst. it was very disappointing and this country could be doing far more to save this wonderful, intelligent Ape, we walked out after about 15 minutes feeling very upset  knowing that time is clearly running out for this wonderful Ape."

We were lucky enough to see 6 or 7 orang-utans happily swinging through the trees or on the ropes and feeding on the fruits supplied by the keepers.

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 29 October 2014,Couples,"We had an incredible day here at the Rehabilitation Centre. We were staying just up the road for the entire day, so we bought our ticket in the morning, planning to use it both for the morning and afternoon feedings. The morning feeding was great, with around 3-4 Orangutans sitting on the platform and devouring all the bananas. There was a mum with a 3 week old baby, and she had a huge appetite, and even helped the member of staff carrying out the feeding up onto the platform with her. There was a lot of other tourists there for the morning feeding, but it was still a great experience. However, we returned for the 3pm feeding, and the number of visitors was greatly reduced, which seemed to bring out many more Orangutans. 2 of the friendlier ones even jumped on the platform right above our heads, and walked within a couple of feet of us. However, the biggest shock was on the way out, as Tompong, a friendly old Orangutan was sitting on the walkway, and walked with us for a few minutes back to the exit! To get withing a couple of inches was amazing, especially as these Orangutans are still semi-wild. Overall a brilliant day, and a cause definitely worth supporting. Great job guys!"

I would suggest getting there earlier if you want and uninterrupted view. There were a host of cheeky monkeys playing on the platform to watch while we waited.One of the team came out at 10am and almost straight away orang utans started to appear through the trees and along the ropes. We saw around 6 in total including a baby with its Mum.The monkeys stayed and tried to steal the odd banana and one orang took great exception to that and started to slap them where ever possible.

The staff were very knowledgeable and there were a lot of opportunities to see the Orangutans being fed during the day (there are 2 feeding sessions every day). Apart from that if you're lucky you'll see them in the wild in the trees etc."
2.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 26 October 2014,,"If the miles of Palm Oil plantations don't depress you then 'feeding time' will. Twice a day the Orangutan's get fed on a platform about 20m away from a great gaggle of people shrieking & pointing flashing long lens camera's in their faces. It is striking that they turn their backs to the crowds. Whilst the idea of a sanctuary is admirable I believe that they need more protection from this too close encounter with people. Therefore, we found the outdoor nursery, (where people were kept behind glass!) a much better experience. Better still is the Rainforest Discovery Centre where if you are lucky & quiet you may catch a glimpse of the lovely ginger ones. "
3.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 25 October 2014,Friends,The afternoon feeding session is better for photographers.  Less people and the light is better.  The orang-utans are backlit.  I saw a baby with a three day old baby. A miracle that it managed to hang on while she swung through the trees
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 25 October 2014,Couples,"Having read a number of mixed reviews I was really surprised about how impressive Sepilok was. We arrived at Sepilok about two hours before the afternoon feeding time and proceeded to go on the trail. This was really enjoyable - although it starts off on a path it becomes a trail very quick so be sure to wear adequate clothing. We got to see lots of other monkeys and wildlife while walking on this trail so well worth a go. We then can back to go to the afternoon feeding and got directed to the nursery as we were still too early. This is where they train the younger Orangutans in the skills they would have been taught by their mothers had the been born in the wild. We got to see a number of small Orangutans play outside from inside (the sanctuary prefer to avoid direct human contact). We then went back to watch the feeding of the adults. You stand/sit on a platform while one of the sanctuary workers places food out on another platform in the distance (you can see it but can't access it - again the sanctuary prefer not to have to close contact because they are trying to rehabilitate them to the wild and because of human diseases). Then you wait to see if any come - which lots did! We got to sit and watch the orangutans for ages while they ate and played together. One thing which I wasn't aware of prior to my visit was that the orangutans in the sanctuary aren't kept in by anything - they are free to roam the rainforest and so sometimes there is a risk that you won't see many of them. However, we got to see about five or six. We were lucky - we visited in October which is relatively quiet and so could see reasonably well from where we were standing. At busier times I imagine it's a bit more difficult - but what I would suggest is waiting around a while until people leave, which we did also and you can get some great photos. Overall I was really impressed - reviews gave me the impression that it was going to be a bit more gimicky/touristy, but the Orangutans are out in the rainforest, unrestricted. Human contact is very limited, but for very good reasons and they staff in the centre are all excellent from what I could see. The fee to get in is also very reasonable."

The ticket is valid for one day multiple entries so you can do both the morning and afternoon feeding sessions. For those hoping to go...the afternoon is much quieter and less people to fight with for a good view. The morning is full of tour groups and is very crowded and noisy...despite the silence signs throughout the jungle.

A raised board walk leads into the park to a very large viewing platform. seats are available at the rear under a roofed section. High in the trees overhead thick ropes are attached looking like a giant spider web. These ropes are used by the orang utans to commute to their feeding platforms. My wife was walking along the board walk when a juvenile animal came along and sat on the opposite handrail, the two of them just looked at each other for a few minutes until a ranger came along and led the orang utan away by the hand. The animal was so close they could have touched each other. A moment that she will remember for a long time."

To be honest I had a better viewing experience of orangutans in the Taipei zoo.

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 7 October 2014,Friends,Loss of habitat due to Palm Oil production and the illegal pet trade are the most significant threats to Orangutans so more and more rehabilitation centres like Sepilok are popping up in Malaysia. They do a great job here to educate people about the plight of the Orangutans and it is a great way to see these gorgeous creatures. It's a pity that people visiting don't follow instructions well when watching the animals though as there were too many visitors at the viewing area and they were noisy.

I have read some of the 'terrible' reviews and I had to stop because they were making me so angry. Conservation is not about pleasing the tourist, it's about protecting the species and education. Do not expect to see a orang-utan, if you do, treat it as a bonus! This is a rehabilitation centre, trying to walk the tightrope of raring and releasing orphaned orang-utan babies into the wild as successful adults but still trying to keep the public happy with seeing orang-utans. It is worth going just to see the work been done by this sanctuary. Though it would be amazing to see a cute baby up close, what effect would that have on that orang-utan if it saw hundreds of people a day. Would it be able to function in the wild? When you have the opportunity to see the orang-utans they are 4 years and up. They are at the stage of semi release into the rainforest. Depending on the season the numbers turning up will vary. In fruiting season expect less orang-utans as food is abundant in the rainforest. Definitely support this centre by coming here!"
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 6 October 2014,Couples,Yes it is a Rehabilitation Centre but this is most likely the only way you will see an Orangutan in the so called wild.  The Orangutan's are in the wild here they opt to come back to feed while they learn how to fend for themselves.  It is well worth the trip to see these amazing animals.

Most orangutans here are rescued from captivity or found unfit to survive in nature. They are then fed and trained here until they are fit enough to be eventually released into nature again. At feeding time, we saw 3 orang utans and many macaques. They are quite adorable from a distance. Highly recommended."

I probably had a too high expectation on what I was actually going to see. Don't get me wrong, it is still good to come here, and support the rehabilitation work, but do not expect to see lots of orangutans - that may not happen as it is up to the orangutans if they want to come to the feeding area. You will see other monkeys at the feeding area. There antics are fun to watch and we saw a couple of babies as well. Some of the monkeys are very dominant and bully the other monkeys off the platform. Interesting to watch."

We actually had our own taxi from Sandakan for the day, which although a lot more expensive than a bus, did allow us to also go to Sun Bears (which is at same location as orangutans); Labuk Bay to see the proboscis monkeys and the rainforest discovery centre, without rushing anything."

After that we followed a boardwalk towards a feeding platform, there the orang utans allready awaited us and more came in. Due massive amounts of tourists it somehow felt unnatural, yet it was good too see the apes having fun.Underneath the boardwalk is a lot of space and if you distance yourself from the hoards at the platform you might get an intimate moment with one of the apes or even other creatures (tarsiers, squirrels, snakes or flying lemurs).There is a trail at the end of the regular boardwalk, we didnt had the time but we heard it was a nice one.Clean and well organised park, with the right attitude towards preservation!"
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 23 September 2014,Couples,"The centre is open just twice a day, for a couple of hours in the morning and in the afternoon when the orang-utans are fed.  It costs just RM30 and for that price you can visit both feeding sessions in that day.You should be aware that the orang-utans that you are visiting have been rehabilitated and live in the wild.  They visit the feeding platform to supplement their diet only.  The centre deliberately makes sure that the food they provide is bland and monotonous so that the orang-utans are encouraged to forage for themselves in the wild.  Because of this you are not guaranteed how many (if any) orang-utans will turn up.  If you want guaranteed non-wild orang-utan sightings you may be better off staying at home and visiting the zoo or visiting Rasa Ria where they wheel out a couple of youngsters for your viewing pleasure.If you want to have the chance of seeing wild orang-utans in a semi wild setting and the knowledge that you are supporting the facility in their on going good work in rescuing and rehabilitating orang-utans, then this is the place for you. On our visit, five orang-utans did turn up (plus a whole troop of very entertaining pig tailed macaques).Two of the orang-utans made their way onto the boardwalk and viewing platform.  One walked so close to me that I could have easily reached out and touched him.  Knowing that human diseases are easily transferred to them, and with superhuman willpower, I resisted the urge to reach out (the ranger was close by and led him a little further out of harms way).  I later learned that this particular orang-utan can be mischievous and was likely to ‚Äúborrow‚Äù my camera given the opportunity!  (There are lockers provided to store all unnecessary items as orang-utans have a habit of taking human trinkets.  This can lead to them ingesting dangerous chemicals/objects).If crowds aren‚Äôt your thing, you may prefer to visit during the afternoon feeding session as it seems to attract fewer visitors.We also paid RM50 each to take a night walk around the centre (for approximately 45 minutes (ours went a bit over that)).  It was well worth it.  We had a private guide and as well as seeing lots of night time jungle creatures (including four giant flying squirrels ‚Äúflying‚Äù from their trees for the night) we were taken through some of the centre that you don‚Äôt get to visit during the day time, including past the enclosures where we were entertained by three male wild orang-utans who had come to visit (and to woo) a female rehabilitee. You may want to invest in a good quality torch for night walks such as this.  Ours was awful, but luckily the guide had a spare we could borrow."

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 17 September 2014,Family,Having read past reviews I was undecided about whether or not to visit sepilok during my two week stay in borneo especially as we are staying in rasa ria resort which has an orangutan sanctuary within its nature reserve and are doing a fantastic job but I am so glad we did! We managed with help of sabah holidays company to organise cheap flights with air Asia to sandakan and had a fantastic day. You watch a short documentary at the start of the tour which is really interesting then it's a short walk to the platform where you see the orangutans amongst other wildlife being offered what's considered supplement foods or snacks as they are encouraged to obtain their main diet from the forest as part of their rehabilitation. It was an amazing experience to get so close to the orangutans and to know that our money was helping to eventually take them back to the wild as I am a huge wildlife lover and give to many such charities with this ethos. I would highly recommend it to any animal/wildlife lovers out there. It was absolutely worth the journey and an incredible experience that will stay with me forever. Huge congrats to everyone at sepilok for all their hard work and our tour guide Connor and organiser stoney for helping make this possible.

I was looking forward to wandering through the rainforest enjoying seeing all the various aspects of it not just the orangutans getting fed which is what happens In the afternoon. Ticket office opens at 2 everyone rushes to buy a ticket you watch an interesting documentary for about 30 mins then are brought to the feeding observation deck (just through the gates) where you wait until 3pm in the heat for them to come and feed them. Dont get me wrong watching the orangutans was amazing they are fascinating creatures i absolutely love them but when there is such a large group of people crammed into one area in the heat it takes away from it a bit. Thats it then all the trails are closed so you make your way out. In the morning the trails are all open. Seems a bit unfair to pay the same in the afternoon but it all goes to a good cause. I think we will visit again in a couple of days in the morning this time :-)
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 16 September 2014,Couples,"Really enjoyed this experience it was nice to see orang-utans in their most natural environment and in a place where they are rescued, cared for and rehabilitated back into the wild; where they belong. I don't understand the negative reviews for this place, the whole point of the facility is rehabilitation! The reason only a few or maybe no orang-utans appear is because they aren't forced to eat the food or paraded for our benefit. The viewing platform looks over the one of the rehabilitation areas where the young orang-utans are encouraged to use ropes and platforms to learn how to swing from trees in the wild. The is no information given at the platform because we are asked to keep quiet, so the orang-utans are not disturbed, and decide if they want to collect the food and be in our company, since we are the ones intruding their environment. There is also food widely available throughout the forest because eyes are taught to forage for their own food. The is a short, but suffice information video after the feeding which explains the role of the the centre and factors affecting the orang-utan environment. There are two feeding per day (10am and 3pm), if there are no orang-utans in the first feeding then you can return (with the single day ticket) for the afternoon feeding. In the meantime there is plenty to entertain with the sun bear and proboscis monkey rehabilitation centres a short walk away. We did this and returned for the afternoon feeding seeing the orang-utans again. Our experience, involved an empty feeding platform and rehabilitation area. But on searching around and scanning the trees you could hear and see the bushes moving. You may have got a glimpse of orange fur through the gaps in the leaves. Then when the trainers brought out the food several (six) organ-utans slowly emerged from the forest, gently ate the food, then disappeared back into the forest. This is a must do experience in Borneo!"

The afternoon session was much quieter and consequently easier to get a good view. We were lucky and saw lots of orang-utans and a couple of macaques. We also saw a few on our way out, which was nice.

4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 2 September 2014,Family,"I had rather low expectations for this Center because many wildlife rehabilitation outfits are very exploitative and essentially use the animals to draw tourists without any real science or rehabilitation taking place.  In other words they are glorified and often unregulated zoos.  Sepilok pleasantly surprised me. In the wild their mothers teach orangutans the skills they need to survive.  The orangutans in Sepilok are confiscated from people that have captured them forest.  Unfortunately they cannot simply be released because they do not have the requisite skills to survive.  The Sepilok organtutangs are taught those skills by humans and gradually released to a semi-wild state.  They are not really wild but live unencumbered in the forest.  Twice a day food is placed on a feeding platform to which they arrive along with dozens of tourists watching from an adjacent boardwalk.  The same food is placed out fro them every day so they become bored with the food and eventually begin to forage on their own. No food, drink, or bags are permitted inside Sepilok and there is a small charge, 20 ringgit, for each camera.  The camera fees are directed toward conservation."

It seems that they don't get much funding from the government, so I didn't mind paying 30 MYR entry to further their program.Apparently you can also do trails whilst there, but on our visit they were closed, so it was the viewing of orang utans only.We caught a taxi for MYR30 to get to Sepilok and MYR6 per person for a van to return to Sandakan town.

Some of the apes may come and investigate you more closely on your walk in or out of the centre but they seem generally not too threatening but it's a good idea not to take too much attractive stuff in with you in case one of them decides to take a fancy to your hat or camera !

Basically the place available for public consists of a walkway and a stage-like area where the feeding is done twice daily. We went to the session at 10am. Six orang utans came, including a 'couple' who did a lot of fun performances to us, and one particularly active orang utan, always posing about, giving us a reason to snap some pictures. It was fun to watch them. Before going in, you'll be asked to leave your bag in the lockers provided (free of charge). Monkeys in general have a tendency to snatch stuff so maybe that's the reason for this. You'll need to pay RM10 to bring your camera in, which is quite pricey. But thinking that the money will go to the orang utans, it's alright."

I absolutely understand what Sepilok are trying to do in raising money to keep their wonderful work going, however, I just would also like to warn people that there will be crowds, and despite the fact that the orangutangs are living freely in the local forest, it still very much has a 'zoo like' feel to the experience.  That said, well worth a visit, particularly if this is your only opportunity to see orangutangs.  The work being done by this organisation is amazing and they deserve to be supported."

The waiting felt like and eternity and I was becoming impatient for the Orangutans to arrive. Finally, around 10am, the keepers walked out through the rainforest, calling the Orangutans. They were tiny and ranged in ages from 1 to 7 years. We watched in amazement as more and more Orangutans came out to eat their favourite foods. At the end of feeding time they got to drink milk from a bucket. At this point you could tell the keeper had his favourite.

Had a wonderful view of the orangs as they swung down on their ropes to the feeding platforms. We watched them eat and play, swing through the trees and show off their gymnastic ability. Also went to see the Sun Bears in their enclosure - there were five out that day, eating, foraging and sun bathing. Went back for the afternoon feeding of the Orang Utans - another fantastic outing in our 3 week trip to Borneo.  We were so fortunate as a few days later Sepilok was closed because a Sun bear had escaped from its enclosure, and while they look like big teddy bears, they have wicked claws meant for tearing and shredding - so public safety came first and the centre was closed for a few days. So glad I visited - got fantastic photographs and wonderful memories. Sepilok tries to rehabilitate Orang Utans so they can learn the skills necessary to survive when returned to the wild, but if the Orang is not ready or not confident to leave the centre, there is no pressure on them to do so. They receive excellent care while there."

The orang utans are absorbing and amusing to watch, eerily human at times and decidedly not at others (eating a banana hanging upside down holding on with one foot).Our first attempt to visit Sepilok was a failure - the centre was closed because a Bornean Sun Bear from the adjacent conservation programme had apparently bribed his warden, slipped the guards and scaled the wall into the Orang Utan section. Sepilok was therefore closed for health and safety reasons. Unbearlievable!Luckily we had time for another visit the following day. From the viewing platform a few metres from the feeding platform, four orang utans swung down ropes to grab some bananas and a bit of melon. These ones are old enough to be allowed to roam the 4,500 hectare forest unattended, but clearly not confident enough yet to get their own food. The video explaining the work of the rehabilitation programme, from nourishing newborns to releasing those able to fend for themselves is excellent. The centre is smart (providing lockers for bags etc, a large cafe and gift shop, and various nature trails).

And yes there is no guarantee of seeing the orang utans. We were lucky enough to see a fair few but if you want a guarantee then don't bother. You have to understand that these animals are being rehabilitated and that at this stage most are semi-wild or totally wild. Of you want a guarantee go to a zoo where they are kept in tiny enclosures. The work this place does is fantastic and the less orang utans you see the more successful their program is. If you are really passionate about animals I highly recommend but if you are going to complain if you don't see anything even though you paid, don't bother."

I got to see the Orang-utans up close, during feeding time, swinging from tree to tree. I got the local (public bus) to get here, it was 5MYR, and then I paid 40MYR for a pass and camera charge, so don't book with a tour agency to go here. Its easier and cheaper to do it yourself. You can also wander across and see the sun bears in the next Sanctuary, or have a look at the rainforest discovery centre. The public bus leaves at 9am (first bus) and the last is at 1pm. Worth it if you're in this area.Its super got though, so make sure you bring a sun hat and have plenty of sunscreen on!"

The keepers impressed as they appear to be fond of the animals and knowledgeable.  Feeding time is the best time to visit of course and it was lovely to observe one of the keepers sitting on the feeding platform with his arm around one orang-utan and the orang-utan with one of his arms around the keeper!

A gentle walk through the jungle on a walkway got us to the feeding platforms, and we settled down to wait. Within a few minutes bushes some 200m away started to move, and peering through the undergrowth we could see orangutans gradually making their way towards us, some along the jungle floor, others in the trees and ropeways. Feeding time was a riot, with some orangutans just eating, but one was attempting to clear up and put all the food back in the basket, whilst another was busy emptying it again. 2 others, after having eaten, continues play fighting - taking turns to slap each other and wrestle.When things quietened down we took the jungle trail, and within a few minutes spied 2 pygmy elephants which had just been rescued gambling around in an area just off the trail - no more than 10m away. Walking through the jungle is a noisy affair, loads of noises very close to hand - but you just can't see what it is due to the dense foliage. Watch out for the lizards and bugs on the jungle floor - some are huge!Reasonable food and drink in the centre's cafe, and worth every penny to support their rehabilitation work."

Seplilok, is well organised, and I know some reviews regard it as no different than going to the zoo. But it is so much more than that??!!! Sure,you might stand with a crowd to observe the animals, but that's just the way it needs to be!! There's plenty of space and opportunities to to take photos or just observe! We were lucky enough to see at least six orangutans at both of the feedings that we attended. Also, there were numerous birds, squirrels, lizards and even a viper curled up in a tree!!! We also took the time to sit in the theatre to watch a video explaining how the rehabilitation process works. It's great work that they do and what beautiful creatures they are!

Also you can come for 2 feedings on the same day for one ticket.It's nice encounter, and as gthe animals should return back to wild, it makes sense that there is no training or too much of interaction with humans. However it misses a bit of information or extra commentary, as the little information provided on the boards in the centre are very basic.We would definitely love to know bit more about the inhabitants of the centre!

The eventual return of these juvenile animals to the forest is the centre's ultimate goal, so it is orang utans first, humans second, so don't go expecting to be able to handle or otherwise be close to these very cute but wild animals.  Walking through the rain forest on the elevated boardwalk is an experience in itself, but the real attraction is the feeding platform and ropes strung from trees so that you can see the teenage orang utans playing and feeding, so like young humans!

If the place does what is says in conservation, then that's a win-win as well. There was no shortage of Orang-utans to see but we mostly had the juveniles who are willing to show up for a banana( they only feed bananas so the diet will bore them in time so they look for their own food and can eventually be rehabilitated). Plenty of good snaps but it's really hot and you can't take water with you. After the feeding we decided to try the bird viewing walk within the forest. No birds but did happen to come across a large pig-tailed Macaque and his harem. Dad thought his boys were wimps when they started running the other way whilst Dad lined up the photo. When I showed it to a local later he just coolly remarked, "" very dangerous monkey"". Ok, Dads aren't always right!"

I was therefore cautious about choosing where to go in Borneo but a visit to Sepilok was a good day and a chance to learn about the good work they do. Orang-utans are helped through the first crucial years of their life and then free to roam in the forest. Some are not seen again once released, others choose to return to the feeding station as much or as little as they like. It is not guaranteed that you will see any at all but that is what makes it a great centre, it is all at the animals choice. We spent time between the morning and afternoon feeds walking the forest trails and had lunch in the well equipped and cheap caf√© at the centre."

From a distance along an alley of clearing the orang hutans will swing their way to the feeding area. For the uninitiated, this can be quite a sight. Orang hutans both young and old were feeding right in front of you. They are so cute and some even mischievous.

We were also in much closer proximity to them at Camp Leake.The pleasant surprise at Sepilok was the recently opened Sun Bear Rescue centre.

We were very lucky again and 7 juveniles came to the first feeding in the morning and 3 in the afternoon.  In between we explored the forest trails and the little cafe for lunch which was excellent.  Many tour companies were only there for either feeding which could result in not seeing an Orang Utan at all if none come to that feeding so to maximise opportunities, it is worth spending the day there.  The contact with the animals is just right and I imagine the number of visitors would be distressing to the animals if they were allowed to handle them.  As it is, the juveniles are in control of the level of contact and can stay away if they wish.  A good establishment and enjoyable day."

There were not many people during lunch closing time so we could easily take pictures without the crowd. At 3pm feeding time, there were more orangutans showed up including a mother and a very young baby. They stayed around for at least 20mins before they returned back to their forest. When we were leaving the parking lot after 3pm feeing, another surprise, an orangutan walked across the parking lot with ease like a human being! It was such great time to see those happy orangutans in this sanctuary. They have done a good job to protect them from palm oil plantations. It is so sad to see miles and miles of palm plantations in Borneo and the natural space for wild life is getting so small. There are few good trails in the park also and you can hike it during lunch time while the offices are  closed. The caf√© in the park has decent food with fair price. There are no other caf√© or restaurants in the immediate area beside a coconut stand outside the park gate.  There are lockers in the park. You are not allowed to take any bag or purse inside the feeding zone.

Apparently at the time we went there was also a orphaned elephant but none one was allowed to view it. Only 3 Orang utans came onto the viewing platform and were not interested in checking out the tourists as they sat with their backs towards us and ate their bananas the left.

Poor things must have been boiling as the temp in the jungle at this time of year feels like 42% plus it is only a short 5-10 minute walk along a board walk from the ticket office to the viewing platform so if your going... wear comfortable clothing & take bug spray.

I loved the place and would return again but beware that there are only two sessions that you can visit Sepilock - a morning and an afternoon session. We stayed for both with the afternoon being the better of the two on the day.We arrived early and were one of the first in, walking along the duckboards through the jungle to the large platform in the middle of the jungle. You can see a number of wooden platforms around trees along with along of rope strung from trees to trees. Rangers/keepers bring out food for the orangutans to eat. Delightful.Be aware though - you cannot get close to these animals - well not deliberately. I'll explain more later. Do not expect that one will crawl into your arms and you can cuddle it. You can't. And nor should you. This is a rehabilitation centre and too much human contact is frowned upon.You also don't get to see the tiny orphan baby orangutans that the Centre are rehabilitating. These little darlings need special care and not westerners perving on them.There are plenty of opportunities whilst on the main platform to take photos, particularly when the animals are eating the fruit and supplementary food. However, they aren't dependant on the food and they are encouraged to forage back into the jungle for more food.There is a little cafe near the sanctuary and we had a great lunch there. Also bumped into alot of young people working for an international aide organisation who had spent days digging trenches. They weren't 'happy campers' and were a bit disappointed they weren't able to spend more time with the orangutans. Odd really, because all info spells it out clearly you won't be handling one.The afternoon session was better on the day we were there. As we came around to the main platform there were a number of smaller orangutans in the trees right near the railing. I must've taken 50 photos. With around 30 people scattered across the platform and a few volunteer rangers (westerners), one of the young orangutans climbed down onto the platform and crawled into the arms of the volunteer. The volunteer was a little nervous, scared and excited and was quietly escorted by the local and more experienced guides away from the group. My daughter was right next to the volunteer when this happened and the orangutan brushed by her. That still gives her a buzz. And that's as close as we got.Staff are great.Food outside good.It rains - bring a raincoat or brolly.Transport to and from is easy.Souvenir shop good - buy something - money goes back to help the orangutans.And please don't come thinking you can handle these magnificent creatures.

The entire Island is being deforested for Palm Oil plantations and this has killed thousands of Orangutans. No habitat = no Orangutans. The knowledge of this problem overshadowed my visit as I find it very sad. The economy of the country has become dependent on Palm Oil export and it has destroyed msot of their rainforests. In the wild an Orangutan offspring will stay with the mother for 6 to 8 years. The babies in the rehabilitation centre are orphans, their mothers mostly killed in the clearing of rainforest for Palm Oil plantations. They keep the orphans separate from tourists to protect them from exposure to disease. It was exciting to see the older Orangutans come down from the trees for the feeding at the centre. I liked the sanctuary and found it well run. We were lucky to see an Orangutan in the forest before the feeding so we watched it eating in the trees for a while, it was a great experience. Since having this contact with Orangutans I am not buying cosmetics or products that contain Palm Oil. I do recommend this Sanctuary if you want to see Orangutans in the forest setting."

What is on offer is limited and poorly displayed. All shirts and T-shirts were in small sizes. Asians may be small, but it is the (large) western tourists I saw forking out US $25.00 for a T-shirt. I found a shirt I liked and I wanted four, but none were in sizes over Medium. Shame!I wanted to adopt a baby orang-utan for $100.00 as a way of giving back to the rehabilitation programme, but the organisers only accepted cash. Apparently the man who operates the cash machine was off that day. So where was the ATM? None! Come back another day......Want to enter the park to see the orang-utans? Bring cash and there is no change for bills in excess of US $10.00. Good thing I was on a pre-paid tour or I would have been really unhappy.Someone with a flair for retail could make a fortune there. The opportunities for top notch, high cost souvenirs, garments and books about the centre and the wildlife would be snatched up by tourists eager to share their experiences with friends at home by giving them orang-utan gifts. There were no calendars or books for sale at all. Duh!"

I'd definitely visit on the way to somewhere but it's a long way from KK if you're just coming for the feeding time, though you are guaranteed to see Orang Utans.As a stop off on the way it was great and well worth the experience.

The only down side was the sun that was hammering down onto the viewing deck. Over half the crowd were stepping further away to the tiny shade part at the back as no one seemed to be able to be in the sun for more than 5mins at a time. was hard to concentrate on the animals.

I learned so much and realized how much our world needs to change in order to save these precious orangutans and other jungle wildlife.  Thank you for the information and wake-up call, especially for people from first-world countries!However, my husband and I noticed some major issues with how rules are enforced within the sanctuary.  The main problem was with the orangutan feeding and viewing platforms.  You are supposed to be quiet but no one seems to care about this.  The tour guides are the worst offenders because they were laughing and carrying on and allowing their customers to do whatever they wanted.  People were yelling and screaming and letting their kids running around like wild banchees!  It was extremely dangerous to the children and orangutans (as the small signs say).  Please have some common sense people.  If you can't get your child to behave, don't bring them somewhere where you are going to stress out the animals.  You are hurting, not helping the situation!Second of all, I noticed that people were smoking cigarettes and trampling the forest (off the trails) when they went for walks around the sanctuary.  Don't they care about the forest burning down or the creatures breathing in smoke?  I'm not sure why there weren't volunteers or staff on the trail to enforce these important rules. :-(So those are the main points of my constructive criticism.  Keep up the good work and hopefully you will be able to resolve these major issues.  Meanwhile, I hope to find products on the market that do not contain Palm Oil so that First-World countries can reduce and eventually eliminate their dependence on Palm Oil.  The jungle should be for creatures only!"

We spent there a whole day, attending both feedings, at 10am and 3pm and they were very different. In the morning, there were many tourists, but there were also many orang-utans to see and they were all very lively. In the afternoon one, there were fewer people, but also there were also 3 orang-utans and they just came to grab some food and went back into the jungle.Tickets cost 30 MYR for adult and are valid for the whole day.We were prepared for a very ""touristy"" attraction, but it turned out to be far from it. It's not quite the same experience as seeing an orang-utan in the wild (we saw one in Danum Valley), but it's close (and definitely a million times better than a ZOO). The centre is essentially just part of the rainforest with some platforms to feed the orang-utans and some ropes to help them get to the platforms to teach the youngsters how to move in the jungle. Overall, you get a feeling that it is a proper sanctuary and not just something made for tourists.During the morning session, it also started raining heavily, but this actual made for an amazing spectacle, as one of the orang-utans started grabbing some tree branches and made itself and umbrella. It them sat under it for a good 20 minutes - it was fantastic to watch!The information centre by the entrance is very interesting. We also did a trek there, but we didn't really see many things (except for lots of leeches). Get good trekking shoes or wellies for the trek - the trails are very muddy after a bit of rain. Note that you have to leave backpack, food and water in the lockers provided if you go for a feeding, but you can take water with you when you go for a trek.There is a sunbear centre nearby, but it's not very good and expensive and there's a Rainforest Discovery Centre about 20 min walk (5 min taxi ride - about 15 MYR) - the RDC is a brilliant - check it out.The on-site cafe has surprisingly good, authentic food (if they have green, coconut-filled pancakes by the till, get them - they were the best thing I've had in my mouth and they only costed .60 MYR each)."

The 3pm feeding is far better than the 10am one, as the morning one is full of people, including many tours.

We saw plenty of macaques on the walk which was surprisingly quiet given how many tourists there were. Its worth getting to the viewing platform a bit earlier to get a good spot at the front because it does get busy. We saw 5 orang-utans in total but only a couple stayed for very long. Its not the most 'wild' experience out there and does feel a little like a zoo, but a great chance to see these amazing creatures if you don't fancy a jungle trek!

The first time it absolutely poured, but the orangutans still came - in fact it was really great to see how they act in that kind of weather, making little shelters/ umbrellas for themselves. The second time it was scorching hot, but a few more came in, including a mother & baby which was quite sweet to observe.  The feeding platform is quite small, but there are a few different vantage points - get in early and get a good spot and you'll see heaps depending of course on the direction the orangutans come in from. It is semi-wild, so you can never be 100% sure how many will come on the day, or how long they'll stay - it's just pot luck. Camera fee (RM10) is not included in the price, but this seems to be the norm. The entire centre is accessed via boardwalks, so you can easily wear thongs/flip flops if you wish. But I'd recommend comfy shoes as you could be on your feet for a while. They do also show a video which runs for about 20 mins - take it or leave it..

The feeding area is mainly meant for baby orangutans so they have somewhere safe to eat and can get used to manouvering around the rainforest in a safe environment. Our guide explained they feed the orangutans the same food every day so that they'll get bored and hopefully venture further into the rainforest for their own food.Feeding time is around 10.30. A ranger puts the food on the platform and then all the tourists wait with bated breath on the viewing platform. We didn't have to wait long - one baby orangutan came swinging along immediately and virtually grabbed the food out of the ranger's hands! This was followed by an older orangutan, who scared the baby away, and then another younger orangutan who tried to sneak food from the platform when the older one wasn't looking!It was amazing to see the orangutans out in their natural habitat, definitely better than anything you can see in a zoo"

However, from the main road it is several miles down the branch road to the preserve, and there does not seem to be public transportation on that segment.  Once in the preserve, you have to pay 40 Ringgit, and store your bag in a free locker.  There is a boardwalk to the spot where the urang utangs are offered food daily at10AM.  The animals may or may not show up for the feeding, depending on their mood.  The day I visited there were about 20 animals showing up successively over about 30 minutes.  They are very used to people, and one of them just came and stood on the boardwalk next to the tourists, until his handler held its paw and both of them walked away into the jungle like a mother and child.  Overall, it was an awesome experience.  There is another feeding at 3PM, but the likelihood to see the animals then is slimmer, since they are less active in the hot hours of the day.

A short walk along the broadwalk led us to a platform where the Orang Utans are fed. They come out at the required time and climb down the various ropes to collect their food as trained! Visitors are crowded into a small area with little shade, when we visited there was probably about 200 people. After being fed the Orang utans disperse into the undergrowth not to be seen again until the next feeding. I was disappointed that I did not get good photographs mainly because I was too far away and the animals did not stay still for long enough nor did they pose for me. !!! After the feeding there are various trails to go on we chose to go on the bird walk.... along the trail are picture of various birds that apparently can be seen. sadly we saw none of them!

The food from first feeding was still there for the second.The Sun Bear sanctuary next door is a much better experience, even if the Sun Bears don't hold a candle to the Orangs in individual charisma, nevertheless we spent much more time with them.The Proboscis Sanctuary, some way further away, offered a big positive surprise. If we had known we would have spent more time there."

We came for the 3:00PM viewing but some of the apes had been there since before 2:30PM, so come early. In total we saw 3 adult and one baby Orang Utan and the experience was interesting and insightful. However, if you only have time to visit one attraction in Sandakan, make it the Labuk Bay Proboscis Monkey Sanctuary as it provides a much more intimate experience with the silvery Lutungs and you can see the Proboscis Monkeys, which are indeed more endangered then the Orang Utans."

You probably would not see them if they did not feed them twice a day - it sort of makes you feel somehow as in a zoo, but I think we should appreciate that this gives us the chance to see some of them hanging around.Having seen the feeding, take the time to take a walk in the fabulous rainforest instead of just hurring on."
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 18 April 2014,Couples,"We enjoyed the sanctuary and spent a whole day here. Feedings at 10.00 and 15.00 were lucky enough to have a couple of orangutans - the first was a mother with her tiny baby (so cute!) and the second a group of juvenile orangutans.  The Bird Trail was also a good experience and we saw orangutan and short-tailed macaques along the way.Good points: Obvious care is shown for the orangutans by the rangers and the conservation efforts have been successful in releasing orangutans in to the wild. The sanctuary seems well-managed and tourists are asked to keep respectful distances from the animals.Bad points: There were SO MANY tourists (including us, of course) which made the feeding time rather noisy and so the animals didn't come close enough for good pictures. Other travelling friends had a rather more quiet visit and one of the young orangutans came right up to them and played in the trees above their heads. It was overall a great experience to see these animals more or less up close and in the wild.

We saw 7 orang-utans and countless macaques, all of whom were playful and engaging.Whilst the orang-utans were more shy and reserved, once the crowds left, the remaining 3 were much more playful.  I suggest hanging around until the staff ask you to leave as the last part is the best.  Next door are the sun bears.  Cute, but clearly insane from being in captivity prior to their rescue.  I really felt for them but was glad they are now well cared for.  All in all you need to allow 1 hr for the orang-utans from 10 and 15 mins or less for the sun bears.  A taxi from the airport is RM30 and takes 30 mins. We asked our driver to stay and he did charging us Rm50 to wait and return and as we were on a flight after lunch, that took way the hassle of finding a new taxi.Well worth the visit!"

Our trip back to KL was due in the evening so we managed to squeeze in some time to visit Sepilok.And it was worth it.Upon arrival, I was told to leave my bag in the car otherwise I might have to leave it at the entrance. This is so as to not attract the orang utans. Just bring along your camera and valuable belongings together with you. Or leaving your bags at the entrance wouldn't be much of a problem. (I am not sure if they have lockers or just simply shelves)After paying a minimal fee, you would have to walk on a boardwalk which goes through the jungle into the feeding area. It is advisable if you could come during feeding time or if you are there early you might want to wait till the feeding time. it is interesting to see. Not only the orang utans, monkeys would also come for the feast of bananas! Watch their hilarious act and it could just simply make your day! I couldn't remember exactly what time, but I assume it should be around 10-11am.Its a total worthy visit to Sepilok.

Being within 4 feet of the orangs makes you realize how much we resemble each other and they look at you like you are friends. We were told not to touch because they are very strong,  and they could injure you without even knowing or meaning to, but the temptation is almost overwhelming.We even adopted a baby orang for 1 year, her name is Beryl,so darned cute.

The wooden walkways are made easier for visitor to track the jungle to the feeding platform. It is good to see the orang utan during it's feeding time at 10.00 am and at 3.00 pm.Make sure you capture lots of picture at this time as it's only last for 10-20 minutes.Unfortunately you can only see them during this time.Being the only orang utan sanctuary in Malaysia it's worth a visit to to get to know the unique and endangered  orang utan. And I think the gallery and video show helping the visitor in general about this center.

It's nothing like a zoo (which we are against). Here the Orangutans chose themselves if and when they want to eat at the feeding platform. They can easily find food for themselves in the rainforest, which gives them the opportunity to chose whether they want to find it themselves or go get some extra at the platform. Ultimately, the sanctuary's goal is that all of them will learn how to live on their own, and be set free. "

2.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 11 April 2014,Couples,"The centre is doing an important job, however as a biologist and tourist I have to say they don't fulfill any tourist needs. I would rather donate the entrance fee than waste an hour out of my way. Its an outdated viewing video followed by an overcrowded 5min walk to a platform where shy orangutangs come and eat for 10min and then leave. No extra information about the forrest, mating or life cycle changes. No extra walkways even though the reserve is 4500 ha big. The nursing platform being built should help, but this is not enough. If you want people involved you have to make them care. I understand the need for keeping people separate from the sanctuary members, but something akin to a personal connection needs to be established or at least more information given. If you would like to make a contribution to the centre I would rather follow their adoption program and help them care for one individual. Unfortunately I have to say the sun-bear viewing platform was even more disappointing. There was a single bear 200m away at the top of a 25m tree. I got one photo in 25 min. And then it camouflaged itself for the rest of the afternoon. Both are however endangered species and it was a privileged to see them. I might be judging to harshly, however I have been to several smaller and less well funded sanctuaries in South Africa with alot more to offer and may therefore be biased."

Easily accessible from Sandakan town, at a distance of about 20km, Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre impresses by its mission: to save and help orphan animals or those who have problems, to reintegrate into their natural environment . The place is very well organized, even in the middle of the rain forest, stretching over a large area, and with great care, so that tourists do not have uncontrolled access outside areas specially designated . Attraction is observing orangutans during mealtimes . With prior appointment can visit the nursery also. Actually before observing orangutans, visitors can watch a documentary movie about them . Is a very usefull and interesting experience specially for kids.Visiting hours are morning and afternoon, with one ticket being able to participate on both. I was fortunate to see many orangutans, even in the morning one female with her little child. And those attending the morning meal, were mostly teenagers and so we had a little show. Although they can occur anywhere, even behind the visitors, as has happened with two of them . What visigrs has to know and understand that is the appearance of animals can not be controlled , they live in freedome and not in cages. So no one can guarantee how many will come.Regarding accomodation. for tourists who want to return to the city, nearby are few places. I stayed at the Sepilok Jungle Resort http://www.sepilokjungleresort.com, a 5 minute walk Rehabilitation Center, a special location in nature . I recommend !...Near to rehabilitation center there is Bornean Sun Bear is Conservation Centre, aimed at rehabilitating and reintegrating these orphan animals back in nature. Is a small species of bear, black and smaller than ""classic"" bear.For transportation from Sandakan to Sepilok, it can contact the resort at which, for a fee, offer this service."

On my first visit to Sandakan in 1998, I saw the Orang Utans appearing from the jungle that was a true jungle then. The animals, orphans from remote parts of the country, were pampered by elderly Orang Utan ladies. Humans did not interfere much. Five years later, in 2003, there was a small strip of trees behind the sanctuary. The rest of the oldest primary forest of the world had been converted into oil palm fields. This time, I did not see any older animals, only orphans fed by humans. During my first visit, I stayed in Sepilok after all tourists had left. And the babies came to me and presented leaves as a present. It did not look like a zoo, but just like a garden of neighbors with strange looking children. To reach the primary forest, we had to travel five hours by bus. And during a 5 hour boat trip on the river Kinabatangan, I had the impression that not much was left from the forest. No wonder that many people find Sepilok resembles a zoo. The nature has gone. Think about this if you order your next portion of fries."

And a nearby bear rehabilitation centre which is also worthwhile for a visit.At the feeding platform however, about 150 primates armed with serious cameras waited eagerly to watch a mere two great apes show up to lazily chew on their bananas and observe the humans. Quite a difference from the scenes at the Proboscis monkey centre at Labuk bay where dozens of monkeys appeared and put up quite a show.Apparantly this disappointing turnout should be explained by enough natural food being available in the forest surrounding the centre so the Orang Utans do not really need the additional feeding.We actually saw a much nicer appearance of a young wild Orang Utan at the Rainforest Discovery Centre who came playing at the canopy walk and was within feet of ourselves."

On the day we were there only 3 came to feed at the morning session, but we were very lucky to see 2 young ones up very close as they came down and walked along the boardwalk with the people there that morning.  You must visit if you want to see the orangutans."

In the end I suppose we were lucky four showed up. Fellow travelers beware, IF they decide to feed, you'll watch them for 15-30mins from about 30 meters away.  There is also a video show that they play, which shows you what they get up to in the rehab center. As informative as it was, you can see similar on YouTube.This place is NOT worth the time and effort to travel to from KK (especially if you are traveling with young children). It pretty much took up one day of our stay for 30 mins of watching orangutans from a distance. We were closer to the orangutans at the local KK Zoo.I can see why some reviewers are referring to this place as a tourist trap!"

I won‚Äôt go into the details other reviewers have already described in a wonderful way (camera fee, insect repellent, lockers for personal items, rain ponchos etc.) nor to the possibility of no orangutans appearing on the feeding platform as they are animals living in the wild and nobody can guarantee their appearance. During our visit which was during the morning feeding, apart from the macaques and their babies two orangutans made their appearance with an amazing ‚Äúshow.‚Äù One of them was sort of waiting for us on the boardwalk being very curious, only 3 meters from us.  The center‚Äôs guards were there, keeping a watchful eye. I characterize the tour emotional cause you can see how closely related humans are with these animals. Their behavior but most importantly their  eyes and staring at you is indicative of the strong bond we share. This tour is a must, especially for kids, before these animals disappear. This tour also is a reminder of our huge responsibility towards these animals and their preservation. Kudos to the Sepilok Rehabilitation center for such a great effort."

There can be a lot of visitors watching so be prepared for that. Our good luck after seeing only monkeys & one Orang arrive for feeding was to be the last to leave the viewing platform. We heard a guide say that she had seen another Orang close by. She was waiting for the visitors to leave because she then felt safe & brought her baby to the feeding station & we then spent time watching her feeding it. Then another young Orang turned up & did acrobatics on the ropes performing amazing upside down routines & enjoying himself. It was a very intimate & touching experience.

To be honest we where a little bit disappointed, because it‚Äôs more like a zoo experience than watching the animals in their natural environment. I know what the purpose of the place is, but I don‚Äôt think that they can reach their goals when the Orang-utans are so used to humans, that even one of them came in the evening to the Jungle Resorts restaurant to find shelter from the heavy rain.Anyway, feeding time is twice a day (10am and 3pm) and the ticket (30RM) is valid for the whole day, so you can go twice. From the counter you walk 5 minutes to the feeding stage where up to 100 people watching and the animals a used to the loud hordes. In the morning we saw one, in the afternoon of the same day four orang-utans. But you will definitely see at least a dozen of macacs, that‚Äôs guaranteed. We went after visiting Sepilok to Sukau by the Kingabatangan River, where you can watch animals (also orang-utans) in there natural environment, so go there when you prefer a more authentic rather than a zoo-like experience."

We thought we missed something by not seeing them come in and when we had the chance to visit again we did. The second visit was so crowded it was ridiculous.  There was a cruise ship in town and I think the entire ship was on the platform.  There was no one to relocate people to make the most of the room on the platform.  We were fortunate and knew the location and went to the far end and were able to have a good view.  The center does great work and I'm glad we went.

We understood that in order for visitors to be more or less guaranteed being able to see orangutans, a rather false situation has to be created I.e. Feeding stations. It was still wonderful to hear these beautiful creatures crashing through the canopy and see them swing down through the trees. Some came near, but did not complete the journey, preferring to observe from the safety of a high tree. It was obvious that these were wild not 'tame' but that they had learnt that humans were not predators and would therefore consent to co -exist in order to enjoy a meal of fruit. Almost all the watching visitors were quiet and respectful, which ensured that the experience felt less like a zoo."

4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 22 February 2014,,"We visited the Sepilok Orang Utan Rehabilitation Centre on Sat 15th Feb 2014 for the 3pm feeding. There are 2 feedings a day, and these are the only times you can visit.Centre opened at 2pm. Price was RM30 per adult (approx ¬£6pp) with an additional ""Camera fee"" of 10RM per camera. Shortly after opening, visitors are invited into a meeting room for a video presentation about the Orang Utans and the rehabilitation centre. The viewing we saw was in English only - the content was very interesting but its impact was sadly lessened by the constant chatter of non English speaking visitors. I am not sure if there are alternative video showings for different languages.After the video, it was on to the Viewing platform via a short boardwalk. Prior to entering the boardwalk, you will need to leave any bags, food and drinks in the lockers provided. Be sure to apply your insect repellent before parting with your bag, but keep binoculars and camera (if you have paid a camera fee) handy.When we arrived at the platform there was a family of long tailed macaques in residence and these were fun to observe and photograph. The views from the visitors viewing platform to the feeding platform are good. It wasn't tooooo busy when we visited, but I could imagine it becoming a bit of a bun fight if your visit clashed with that of a coach party or two.Once feeding began, we saw 3 Orang Utans come to feed. It was great to see them traverse the ropes and interact with each other. Binoculars will really help you spot the Orang Utans ahead of the crowd.Our visit was over by 3.20pm so this is not a place where you will spend the day, but it is worth combining with the nearby Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre or the Rainforest Discovery Centre."

Found that the afternoon feeding time was better than the a.m. as fewer fly-in tourists are there by mid-afternoon (groups fly over from KK in the early a.m., but return flight conflicts with afternoon feeding, so you only get ground based tour groups competing for space on the viewing decks in the afternoon!)  With fewer crowds, there's less noise which seems to bring more orang utans closer to the crowd. A terrific experience. "

We stopped by while we were waiting to go to Uncle Tan's camp and found the centre quite pleasant. The only gripe I had was that it is expensive and very touristy. There is a charge for cameras, luggage storage, as well as a entry (which was double the price of a lot of other Orangutan Centres). However, this was the best of the Orangutans we visited in Borneo.There is also a Sun Bear Centre nearby, and it would have been good to be able to by tickets for both with a discount. We went over to the Sun Bears after the Orangutans, but decided paying the full price again for admittance wasn't worth it. The number of tourist at the park was annoying, but considering that is how they raise funds for the maintenance and up-keep of the centre I can't really complain about it. People just need to remember to be considerate of others when traveling and visiting places like this."

The morning feeding is much more recommended, even if you have to compete with more visitors for a spot to take pictures. During the morning feeding, three orang utans came, along with a bunch of macaques which tried to sneak some of the food away. All the animals ate their food while being suspended in the cords, or sitting on a tree. That was very fun to watch. The afternoon feeding is not as lively, the ranger actually had to bring two orang utans with him, and they just sat on the platform and just ate, before going away. All of it felt staged. However, the afternoon visitors were all polite enough to sit down, so everyone had a good spot for their pictures.The Sanctuary also has a few trails, but they were muddy and required rubber boots to walk them (can be rented for 10RM), so we skipped them. If you want a good jungle walk, go next door to the RDC, you'll have enough trails to last you an afternoon (which did not require rubber boots at the time)."

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 13 February 2014,Couples,"As my wife and I had enjoyed our visit to Semenggoh Wildlife Centre near Kuching a year ago, we decided to visit Sepilok in late January, 2014 staying for both the morning and afternoon feedings.  In the morning, we saw four orangutans, two sets of mother and offspring.  In the afternoon session, no orangutans appeared from the forest.  The Sepilok staff member who brought the food to the feeding platform brought two juveniles from the rehabilitation center with him.Compared to Semenggoh, Sepilok has better visitor facilities including a visitors center, wooden walkways, a restaurant, a video showing (broken projector when we were there), and trails into the forest.  Unlike Semenggoh, they did not close the center to visitors an hour after the feeding.  Sepilok also did not use human calls to try to attract the orangutans like Semenggoh did.The advantage of visiting Semenggoh is that the rangers gave a short talk before the feeding, telling the visitors what to expect.  At Sepilok, there was no talk.  At Semenggoh, if no orangutans came to the feeding platform, the rangers would try to locate them in other parts of the sanctuary and lead the visitors there.  At Sepilok, if no orangutans appeared, you were out of luck.  The number of orangutans that we saw at both centers were similar.Overall, we enjoyed our visit to Sepilok.  We expected to see more orangutans but we understand that this would vary by the day and time of year.  Our tip for visiting Sepilok is to arrive by 9am to watch the video, go to the 10am morning feeding, have lunch in the restaurant, visit the newly opened Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre next door, then return for the 3pm feeding.  We actually enjoyed our visit to the Sun Bear Conservation Centre more than Sepilok.  We hired a taxi through the hotel to drive us from Sandakan, wait for the morning and afternoon viewings, and take us back to Sandakan.  The going rate is 120 RM."

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 15 January 2014,,"Firstly, I think that anyone that complains about having to pay 30RM (roughly ¬£6) to come so close to these animals or found it all too ""touristy"" need to stop and think about what is actually going on here. The sanctuary is just that, a sanctuary. It is not a zoo and there are no barriers for the apes to be confined within.The whole concept of the place was set up to save, protect and rehabilitate this endangered species in order to protect it. No, it isn't natural to have a viewing platform or feeding times, but it is obvious that this place is doing good work here and unfortunately this good work doesn't come for free, so they charge. It's true, you may see an organ utan, you may not, but either way you are supporting an extremely good cause regardless. On the day that we went, we arrived too late to watch the video, so headed to the viewing platform immediately. My boyfriend and I had it to ourselves for 10 mins, during that time we witnessed a rather impatient young male literally hanging around for his breakfast. He looked healthy and happy - which is something you rarely see from these lovely creatures in a ""zoo"". As the food came out so did an adult female and male. We watched for 40mins as they ate and played on the branches and ropes above our heads. The people viewing with us (although a relatively large group of people) were respectful of the silence rule (as were the wardens) and bearing in mind I am not a fan of touristy crowds, I actually found the whole thing rather peaceful.The organ utan made a run for it as a rain shower came through the forest (and so did many of the visitors) but we stayed on a bit to watch our original young orang utan hang about it the branches about 2m from us. As he hid from the rain, we saw him fashion a little rain hat out of the leaves nearby - again, an experience you wouldn't get in a zoo...and something definitely worth paying ¬£6 for.So this is not the thrill of walking through untouched forest and witnessing animals in a totally wild environment (if you want that experience, I suggest you pay 500RM and hire a guide for the day) but it is certainly worth the trip considering the good work that the sanctuary is doing.Getting there: we got a taxi for the day, booked through our hotel (Four Points in Sandakan) for 250RM (¬£50) that took us to Sepilok Sanctuary, the Probicus monkeys and the Rainforest Canopy walk. It was amazing value! Highly recommend this option if based in Sandakan and you can't face figuring out the bus. "

There were a few children who were very noisy but this didn't seem to bother the orangutans and macaque that came down to feed immediately. However, staying on when the majority of other people (particularly the noisy children) had moved on was a definite bonus as a wild orangutan with a baby came along. We saw a giant squirrel on the way back which was a bonus - would definitely recommend this trip."

I was really disappointed in the visitors who despite the signs indicating the need for silence were incredibly loud. This really impedes the work of the sanctuary to rehabilitate the orangutans back into the wild. I would recommend the staff give one warning and then kick those out that don't abide by the request.

Well worth the trip as you will get close and personal to the main event of feeding. The monkeys that are waiting for food scraps also give plenty of entertainment but be wary of the odd aggressive male on your walk around! There is also a bird walk within the sanctuary which could be taken between feeding sessions, ensure that you have leech socks though. Camera tax is payable here as it is in most attractions, bags and contents are not allowed in, however there is a guarded locker area for safe storage whilst you are enjoying the attraction."

We stayed around for a while, just sitting in the quiet enjoying the rainforest. We then had enough time to walk the 2k to the Rainforest Discovery Centre although there were taxis hanging around. We walked around there for couple of hours before getting back in time for 2pm showing of the video.

Orphaned, injured or displaced orang utan babies are rescued from the wild and given a chance to be reintroduced to the wild.  In the centre, they are trained in the life skills of foraging for food, swinging on the branches, making nests, etc. -- all these which are supposed to be taught by their mothers.  The centre is doing a great job rehabilitating these orang utans and they should rightly be supported.  That said, the orang utans are a delight to watch.  The younger ones are active and, like human teenagers, would play rough-and-tumble games with one another.  The older ones would sit quietly and mind their own business.  The mothers would be minding their babes-in-arms.  It is a community indeed.We stayed around the centre for both feeding sessions as we are quite enamoured with the ""Man of the Forest""!If you can adopt a baby orang utan, do it!

You buy a ticket, take a walk along a wooden boardwalk to a viewing platform that looks out onto a large feeding platform attached to a tree trunk. A guy goes out there & puts bananas and other snacks on the platform and in come the orangutans...then macaques. You're so close. It's incredible. We had actually seen one of the orangutans at breakfast time before we even went to this place. He was in a tree outside the resort's main lodge waiting for someone to give him food. They're adorable and, if your going to Borneo, this is a must-see. Go on youtube beforehand and watch some of the short documentary type videos on the place so you can learn about their mission. Oh, if you're going after Feb., 2014, you HAVE TO see the Bornean Sunbear Conservation Center, which is right across the street. They don't officially open until then, but I can tell you - it will be another unforgettable experience."

Because the orangutans also find their own food  within the sanctuary there is no guarantee as to how many you may see.A good idea is to have your own transport and go to both feedings. We went to the morning feed  were we saw three young orangutan. We then went to the nearby proboscis monkeys -drove back and had lunch at the sanctuary then went to the afternoon feed where we saw five or six. As we were leaving along the walkway a extrovert young male decided to come down and followed us long the handrail, stopping for photo shoots!We were in love and adopted a young male for our grandsons.

4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 30 November 2013,Couples,"Being as we were in Borneo, we decided to make the trip from KK to Sepilok to see the semi-wild orangutans.  It was a long day and a long way to go, just to see orangutans, but we thought it was worth it.  We booked our flights a couple of days prior, direct on the internet with Malaysia Air, which was very easy, but then we decided to go for a tour which included return transfers from our hotel to the airport, the Sepilok Centre in the morning and a city tour in the afternoon.  With hindsight, however, we would have preferred more time at Sepilok, and less time in Sandakan as the City isn't really that interesting in itself, sorry Sandakan.  There seems to be lots to do around there but not much that you can do in just a few hours, while waiting for your return flight to KK, which was delayed by an hour, so there was a lot of wasted time sitting around at the airport, where there's nothing to do or see, apart from staring at a planeless runway and a construction site.  We were lucky though, we saw five or six orangutans that came down for the morning feed, together with lots of smaller monkeys that came to clear up the leftovers afterwards.  We should have seen a film in the information centre before going to see the orangutans, but we couldn't due to something else going on in the same room, so they asked us if we would watch the film when we got back.  Unfortunately, we stayed longer watching the wildlife, which is what we went for, so missed the film, due to having to be back with our driver at 11am, for the drive back to Sandakan.  All in all a worthwhile experience that we might not get the opportunity to do again, but we would have preferred longer seeing the wildlife."
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 30 November 2013,Solo,"As with all locations in Sabah, the Sepilok Orangutan sanctuary is a good distance from downtown Sandakan, so it's better to arrange for a taxi or car for the half an hour ride to the place.At the entrance is a sprawling plaza that includes a restaurant, a small museum (no footwear allowed inside, a film is also screened in an adjoining room here), toilets, gift shop and ticketing counter. The ticketing counter and gift shop are opposite to each other in the same building.Before you go in, you are advised to leave your bags in a locker, as the orang utans can, I said can (they did not when I visit. (There is a small display in the museum as to what the orang utans have snatched from earlier unfortunate visitors.)I had my zoom lens inside my bag, and no amount of protests would make the staff relent. I finally had to put the zoom lens into my pocket, making for a large and embarrassing bulge on one side, but I had to leave the sling bag in the locker. They give you the key and log in your name and locker number in a register. Staff are quite friendly.Remember that the bags locker (and museum/ film screening room) and ticketing counter/ gift shop are in OPPOSITE buildings. Once you have that sorted out, you can cross over to the ticketing/ gift shop building and walk out onto the boardwalk to get to the orang utans. A short while later, a chap in a tiny booth checks your ticket and has you 'wash your hands' with liquid soap. A wash basin is provided nearby but is not really needed as the soap evaporates pretty quickly.After that it's a long walk on a delightfully wooded board walk to get to the orang utans. If you are going there independently, remember to go during feeding times. There are two feeding sessions: 10:00 and 14:00. That's when the orang utans appear on the feeding platform. The rest of the time, you will have little else to see.The feeding platform is mid way up a tree and you can see it from a large board-walk viewing area. And it was a good thing I decided to bring my 70-300 zoom lens along, the embarrassing bulge and discomfort notwithstanding, as it's otherwise difficult to get very good photos of the orang utans. The viewing area gets pretty crowded though, and it's difficult to get a good vantage point thanks to the scores of gawking tourists, another reason to bring a decent zoom lens.We could spot only about four orang utans. They appear at the set time one at a time, and entertain you with their antics. An attendant soon appears with a basket full of fresh fruit, which comprise mostly of sugarcane and bananas. The apes keep a respectable distance until he has placed the fruit on the feeding platform, and the descend on it to feed.We saw about four orang utans in all, one of them looking positively under fed and skinny. This facility is supposed to rescue and rehabilitate orphaned or captive animals and train them to survive in the wild before releasing them back into the forest, so the skinny one had apparently been just rescued.You can watch the animals feed and do their antics while the bored attendant sits on the the board walk waiting. He did not acknowledge the crowds at all. No wave, no smile, he just kept sitting there. The apes on the other hand kept coming onto the platform, grabbing fruit, then getting onto the over hanging ropes to do their usual monkey antics, much to everyone's amusement. One greedy chap in particular had two bunches of bananas in two of his feet, and was stuffing his face with more bananas with one hand, using the only other free hand to hang from the rope overhead!Later, regular monkeys, like pig tailed macaques and long tailed macaques join in the feast. They come REALLY close, onto the railing we had been leaning on, so be careful. Do not get too lose as these are wild monkeys. Pig tailed macaques in particular have a nasty reputation. They do not bother with the gawking humans though, although they will snarl and bare their fangs if you try to get too close.You then return to the entrance by completing a loop on the same board walk you came in from. (you cannot backtrack). At the exit to the boardwalk you meet the same chap again who provides you liquid soap to 'wash your hands'.All in all a rather interesting experience. Only, no bags inside, so if you are carrying a zoom lens, wear loose clothing!"

Prices were given for the tour but that did not include an airfare.  If anyone wants to go to Sandakan for a day trip, I advise to book the fare (we used Air Asia which was quite cheap) before you get to KK.  It took forever trying to get a cheap fare on the internet.  You can drive but it is a good 8 hours each way, only 35 minutes each way by plane.  The centre was very nice, lots of signage about the animmals.  As they are in the wild, it is up to them on the day as to how many come to feed.  We saw about 5 oran utans in the trees, but they had their backs turned to us (who can blame them?) so we didn't actually see much.  We had booked a whole day tour which included several other sights.

We were lucky enough to see a further 7, including a mother with child and a completely wild orang-utan which had never been seen at the centre before. There are no fences here, the animals are free to come and go as they please.

In addition, the orangutans were inactive and were obviously not hungry. They just sat there on the platform ignoring the food laid out on the floor by the feeders. Throughout the 30-minute feeding, the orangutans ate a couple of leafy stalks each. I have to say that the event was rather boring. At the end of the feeding session, the men left and other species of monkeys appeared to grab the food and the orangutans disappeared via the ropes. The boardwalks are well maintained and the rainforest will fill you with awe. Go visit this attraction for its natural beauty and the Rainforest Discovery Centre next door.

Naturally, many people are aspiring to want to have their pictures taken with the gentle creature but the reality of the matter is that they are best left to their own devices.  Readers would understand this statement after watching a succinct but pertinent documentary shown at the Centre, which is made by an English journalist.  The rangers and the vets that work tirelessly behind the scene are the saviours for the creature that isn't able to fend for themselves.  I find the whole situation rather ironic considering that we, humans are the culprit who's destroying the habitat of orang utan in the name of greed (logging activity and also, palm oil plantation).  End of the year is normally considered as fruiting season & by default, orang utans are less inclined to head to the feeding station for food because food would be in abundance in the jungle itself.  Despite heavy rain, I was rewarded with the presence of four orang utans who took their time in going through all the provided fruits.  Ultimately, there's a fine balance between rehabilitation of orang utans versus exploitation of orang utans to make money.  Suffice to say that this Centre has been outstanding with its educational programs for both tourists and local students alike.  You could see throng of students here.  Ultimately, there's only one purpose to be here and today, I am not disappointed.  Anyhow, walk the talk.  Sponsor an orang utan today and at MYR$80, it's highly affordable for tourists from mainly U.S.A. and United Kingdom.  A must visit."

If you really want some adventure you have to see them in the wildness for example in danum valley, this was more than amazing!"

2.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 4 November 2013,Family,"If you read other reviews, then turn up yourself to find only two youngish orangutans having a snack on the man-made platform, as we did in October 2013, you could put it down to bad luck. (Others we talked to, who had been there a few days before, also saw merely two.) If you have read about other walks, and actually see the wooden walkways snake away into the jungle, some reported to extend for some kilometres, but discover that all are closed off, even at 10.30 in the morning, one wonders if maintenance is down, or the park staff are unmotivated. I have since spoken to someone who was there in April, who reports that they closed down the longer walkways when there was incursion troubles from the Phillipines some distance south of Sandakan at around that time. Is it possible that is still the reason for not opening up the longer walks? (The incursions have already been dealt with.) Or have standards merely been allowed to slip? A lesser point: do they really need to charge for cameras - but not for phones - when almost all phones these days have cameras built in? Value for money - nope. (By far the best sanctuary I've been to as far as seeing orangutans is concerned is the one near Tai Ping on Peninsular Malaysia - although the Tourist Authority official site doesn't even mention it!)"

There is a visitors centre, with a lot of interesting information, which families would find interesting too.  We were taken by our guide Benie, and she gave us a greatdeal of information about the Orangs and her experiences over the years.  The feed time arrived 10am, and almost on cue an Orangutan mother and baby arrived to be fed first.  The monkeys soon arrived and one large male muscled in and kept all of the other monkeys of the feeding platform.  Then two more orangutans arrived.  Eventiually they al left and the other monkeys moved in.  Plenty of photo apportunities.  Our guide then subtly suggested we wait for the other visitors to leave and to walk back on the boardwalks quietly.  Then Ringo made himself known!  He was sitting in a tree just watching very one else leave.  We patiently waited and he came down to show off and have many photos taken - he really did pose too!  This was really special as he was so amusing and perfect to watch, without a large group to be noisy and impatient.  After a while he got bored of us and swung off through the trees and we then left really happy with our visit."

I would have liked to go without being herded into the obligatory video first.  It was not very clear at the outset that there were also walking tracks in the centre, but they close at 2, which was disappointing as we came back to walk them only to find we were too late.  On the upside, we then walked to the Rainforest discovery centre for a great afternoon instead.  Plenty of orang utans at the feeding (wish the people would actually keep quiet when asked!), also pig tail and long tail macaques.  Would have liked to do the night walk but it stormed.... perhaps next time.

And aside from the man of the forest, they are also known to care for animals such as that of the rhinoceros, elephants and crocodiles. There are dedicated feeding hours where visitors would get the chance to view up close for themselves on the orang-utans who would come by for their daily dietary supplementation. The experience is top notch and there are more than adequate information on display to advocate education to tourists on their conservatory efforts of the monkeys. A short video show likewise gives proper explanation on how the orang-utans are saved and then rehabilitated to survive in the wilds through varying stages based on their growth, maturity and development. It is interesting to note that the local federal and state government has allocated a large amount of funds to help in the conservatory efforts of the orang-utans which are now threatened with extinction from the cutting down and clearing of the tropical rainforest. Visitors are offered to do their part in adopting an orang-utan at a nominal fee per year to aid in the training and feeding of the former before they are then released to the wild. They are each affectionately given a name and their distinctive facial and hair features are what gives them off."

We were fortunate to see four (3 adults and a baby). It wasn't busy at all, maybe because it was the 3 PM feeding.

Very informative, friendly staff and overall obviously a very caring place for these most beautiful beings that can be seen playing, eating and responding to staff.  For those wanting up close and personals with the orangutans you may be disappointed as the twist in this place thankfully is the humans are in the cage and orangutans free to run wild in their natural environment.

There are some here in rehabilitation prior to release back into the wild, some who are institutionalised and won't leave the centre and some who are now wild but come back for an easy meal.  Regular feeding times from 9am (a good early slot as it will not be busy) but do the excellent video presentation which precedes the feeding experience. It seems there is no guarantee to have a sighting but this place must be the safest bet to bag an orang utan in Borneo. Having said that this is no substitute for seeing them in the wild but your photos / video (additional 10rm each) you shoot here will be easier and better quality than in the rainforest.  After the keeper puts out the food and the primates move in there seems to be no rush to usher you out for the next sitting. Cafeteria and good toilet facilities here and a free locker to store your bag / valuables is a bonus."

We were shocked though by how much we got to see though in the afternoon.There were a couple tour groups along with us and so the area was not crowded.  Early on there was a mother and her baby and a smaller male Orang Utan showed up as well.  For a while it was just those Orang Utans and so many of the tour groups left, and almost on cue after the tour groups left more orangutans showed up.  2 larger males and a smaller male all came to feed.  Then a type of monkey showed up (forgotten the type) as well as a squirrel that were trying to steal some of the food and they continued to interact with each other and it was all very entertaining.  Eventually the rangers made us leave as they wanted to close up but at that point it was only us and a few other people so we had some amazing photos of the orang utans and monkey interacting.

I was unsure whether to go or not because I really wanted to see Orangutan in the wild, not in what might turn out to be a zoo! I was, however, pleasantly surprised. There are usually about 20-30 Orangutan being rehabilitated in the centre. When they first arrive, they are put into quarantine to make sure they are disease free before moving them to the ""communal"" area. it must be quite hard for the animals to live in quite close proximity to each other as they are solitary individuals. They are fed twice a day and are at liberty to choose whether or not to come down to the platform. Some do whilst others prefer to feed on the fruiting trees around them. The feeding area has a large viewing area for visitors and there is a system of ropes for the primates to move around on.Sometimes other animals get in on the act - a greedy Pig-tailed macaque came to visit while we were there! I felt t was a privilege to be so close to these wonderful creatures though it was much more exciting to see them in the wild! They are actually released at Tabin, in two stages. Firstly they are monitored to make sure they will cope on their own and then they are released into the jungle well-away from the road. Orangutan have wonderful memories and some have been known to return to the rehabilitation centre for an easy feed or just to say hello! :) he big chap on the platform during our visit was a past resident - the keepers know all their residents and he wasn't a current guest!P.S. If you visit, beware of weeing Orangutan overhead! One of their party tricks....."

Get there in good time before the ffeding, and you might get some solo time With the men of the forest.  The most annying thing is all the children screaming, i would advise to give them and their parents a nasty look. In Oktober 2013 the only open trail was the bird trail. We walked there hoping to see some apes, but no Luck. It is a really Nice trail anyways. Watch the Movie, It is very well made and informative. I would advise to stay in one of the Budget accomodation around the Sepilok area, as you can go to both the feedings then. IT is worthwhile to get the most out of Your experience.

I might be wrong, but just the way they approached had that look about it.    There was a nice boardwalk through trees as we approached the viewing deck.  The viewing deck was crowded and very hot in the sun.  The orangutans didn't come very close to the deck and there was no commentry or explanations.  Only 4 Orangutans turned up for that feeding.

Before the feeding session they show a quite interesting video about the centre and the aim of the project but I keep having my doubts about these rehabilitation centers. I hope they just want the apes to recover and go back to the jungle but all these commercial activities around the centre don't convince me about that.Ticket is 30MYR, they say it is not 100% sure you will see Orang Utans but I think it is very unlikely you don't. When I went (afternoon session) there were about 10, small, big, a mother with the baby, a bit of everything. I stayed until the last one left and this is something I strongly recommend to do because most of the tourists leave after 20/25 minutes, it becomes much less crowded and you enjoy it more.For sure, if I was lucky enough to see them in the real wild life I wouldn't have gone to Sepilok.I just hope everything is done for the Orang Utans good."

There was a ranger/guide on the viewing platform who was happy to answer questions. He even pointed out when a Hornill bird was calling unfortunately we didn't see it. The rangers just don't make it obvious they are there. This adds the idea that its a natural environment not a tourist trap. Both feedings were crowded but I don't think anyone felt they missed out. The morning feeding seemed to have an older crowd with more families whilst the afternoon had more young couples/groups of friends. As such the afternoon crowd started to get a bit noisy whilst waiting but the ranger just walked through with the silence sign and they settled down. Going to both viewings meant we saw a total of about a dozen different orangutans, numerous macaques and a few cheeky squirrels. This was far and above the number I had hoped to see.The cafe served good food and the toilets were the cleanest public toilets I used in Borneo. The only disappointment was the souvenir shop.

In the end, we only caught glimpses through the crowd.After quite some time trying to see the orangutans, we decided to wander the boardwalk and see if we could spot any more orangutans however, when we got to the junction (exit or longer boardwalk) the longer boardwalk was closed for maintenance.There should have been some notice at entry to advise of the works.

Camera fees  are 10 MRs each (about ¬£2).A 20 minute film show was interesting and has useful background information to the sanctuary.The animals do not behave as they would in the wild, but you can get some clear photos, video clips easily.It is only dive minutes walk from Sepilok Nature Resort and Sepilok Jungle Resort.  We went three times and loved each visit.  It is better to see them in their natural environment, but obviously they are much harder to see."

Upon arrival you watch a half hour video of the work in the centre and are treated to a short talk from one of the volunteers who was very informative and passionate. From there you have a short walk to the feeding platform. Even on route to the platform we spotted giant squirrels and snakes. Upon arrival it wasn't long before the orang-utans came to the platform to feed. You get a few hours to stand and watch them play, eat and nest it was stunning. We were lucky enough to see a mother and baby with was magical. I would recommend a visit here to get truly close to nature and observe the orang-utans in their natural habitat. Loved it. "

Upon arrival we watched a video that explained the reserves work telling the visitor hoe they rescue the orpahned & illigally kept creatures then how they rehabilitate them before releasing them into the wild. It was very interesting giving me a better understanding of the animals & the reserves work. Then we went to the feeding station & were lucky to see six come down for breakfast - one had a baby. An amazing place & a well worth visit. You can also adopt a baby oranutan

I thought the entry price was resonable, as you could see the ammount of ongoing upgrades they make to the centre, and it was all very professional. After a 10 minute walk through the boardwalks to get to the feeding platform, there was a small crowd of people gathered waiting. We were lucky enough to see about 7 orangutans and 1 with a baby. On the walk back to the centre we were visited by 2 young orangutans who climbed on the board walk and were mere meters from us. It was amazing. So good in fact that i went back solo the next morning and saw the morning feeding session. This was definately a lot more busy, so i would recommend the afternoon session if you have time to make both. We couldnt find an overpriced taxi available to take us back to sandakan, and while waiting at a small food stall on the road just outside the orangutan center, we hopped on the sandakan- sepilok public bus, and it only cost us 3 or 5 myr each to get to the central bus station.

Even though the tracks were closed due to maintenance work we had the chance to admire the Orang Utang while eating which is no doubt something really exciting. It's worth a visit. The night-walk in the forest was also very interesting but you need to accept that there are leeches. Insect-repellent is ok, the leeches protections  (socks) sold at the center are not good. It would be better to bring them from  your home country. "

After having seen only 4 visitors at the RDC, it was quite a shock to see the very crowded car park. Lots of tour groups with people looking ready to hike through the jungle safari clad and in serious hiking gear. Very well organised centre and staff. We arrived just in time to lock our gear away and walk the 5 minute to the platform. Have a drink beforehand, as you are not even allowed water or anything but your camera inside (understandable). It was packed and people were trying to all get the best positions which doesn't bring out the best in human behaviour. We saw one snake on the way there, apparently they are quite common and most of them are poisonous. The very young orang utans appeared already before feeding time - there were only 3 of them and it was lovely to see but a very different experience from what we expected. Very very touristy. Apparently the afternoon feeds are quieter. We saw the 20 minute movie afterwards which put the work they do there in context and should not be missed.The cafe is cheap and quite good but the lady on the roadside just outside the gate makes the way better food. She also called us a taxi back to Sandakan for 40RM.It was an interesting experience but not impressive. If you go with kids, go early because not one single adult will give up their place in front for them to see anything or put them on your shoulders. You also have the full hot sun on you the whole time you are on the platform at 10am which can get quite uncomfortable. We have done a lot of wildlife experiences with kids and this one was among the least impressive for them. More of an adult thing I think. People who have done both rate the centre near Kuching much higher as an overall experience. If you are reading this, may be check out both reviews and make your mind up, We came to Sandakan for this experience only and it was a little disappointing."

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 1 September 2013,Solo,It is worth noting that all the rainforest walks here are shut at the moment so all you can do is attend the feeding session at the centre.  This involves walking along a wooden walkway to the feeding area were you wait for the Orangutans to arrive and feed.  It is very hot here so do be prepared for this as there is little breeze! However for the entrance fee you can attend both the morning and afternoon feeding sessions which if you are staying locally is a must as I had been told and found for myself that the afternoon session is a lot quieter with fewer visitors and the Orangutans come a lot closer to you.  I had one come to within 1 meter of me! Amazing.Back at the main entrance there is a film show which appears under viewed but with provides a great 10minute DVD about the centre which is great and it is also air conditioned which is a nice relief after an hour at the feeding platform! There is also a small museum which is also interesting and underviewed.  Going to the centre is a must in any trip to this area.

It's actually a good sign if there are only a few because that means these rehabilitated apes are learning to find their own food in the jungle. I recommend going to both feedings because you may see different orangutans and the lighting is different for taking pictures. There was also an orangutan who came out of the trees to look for food by the cafeteria. She was right at the window where we were eating lunch. (The cafeteria food was cheap and decent, by the way. There are drinks and snacks to buy too.)Unfortunately, the walking trails are currently closed for renovation. It would have been nice to have something like that to do between feedings. The center does good work. Watching the video is a good way to learn about it."

All in all we saw 13 Orangutans including two nursing mothers. fab-u-lous!!On the way out a family of macaques were close to the walk way and we managed to grab some great pics.

We stayed for both the 10:00am and 3:00pm feeding.  One or the other may be enough, but we enjoyed the 20 minute video, walking around and learning more about these interesting animals.  The feedings were enjoyable.  Yes, there are lots of people.  Yes, some were noisy, but that's expected.  We still saw 10+ orangutans at the first feeding and 6-7 at the afternoon feeding, making it enjoyable.  We stayed at Paganakan Dii Tropical Resort, and they provide free shuttles to and from the Centre, so if you plan to visit, my tip would be to avoid Sandakan city and sleep in the rainforest with the nice accomodations at Paganakan Dii.  Stopping at Sepilok while touring Sabah in Borneo, I think, is a must-do despite all the tourist hype and ongoing construction."

If you arrive during feeding times its great to see them all start swinging their way through the trees to get to the food. There were even some little babies hanging onto their mothers, it was adorable. The center itself provides you with a lot of information, there is a room outside the sanctuary with all the information you could ask for as well as a video that plays many times during the day providing you with extra information about the orangutans and the work that is done at the sanctuary.There is also a souvenir shop where you can find many trinckets to take home with you as well as a cafateria incase you might get hungry. I was a bit disappointed with the fact that the walking trails were closed for construction but what cn you do, they have to do it sometime. Although since the trails were closed and you only got to see the feeding platform with a little walk after I do think the price should be brought down. Otherwise it was worth the trip."

You could do them both outside of a package, but both are a good distance away from Sandakan so you'd need to hire a taxi/driver for about half a day and get the timings right to make sure you reach both at feeding time, otherwise you probably won't see much.

We only expected to see the Orangutans from afar on the feeding platforms but as soon as we entered the walkway athere was a rustling in the trees and a youngish Orangutan climbed down from the tree next to us and onto the walkway, escorting us to the feeding platform! AS the feeding was going on i noticed another cheeky youngster on the exit walkway so we went in for a closer look. Be carfeul not to get too close though as they are semi-wild and we heard that the centre had been closed temporarily before we arrived as an Orangutan had attacked a woman to get her camera. We didn't see anything like that when we were there though, the wardens soon chased the naughty little ones off the walkways if they saw them but they just swung back around to pose in a nearby tree!! Amazing. One thing i would say is, make sure you have a decent camera that is good in low light conditions or you will not be able to get any decent shots."

We were lucky, we had 5 orangutans turn up for their food, including a couple of little ones that entertained the hordes. We watched them do their thing for about 40 minutes, after which they wandered back into the bush, and all the Rubber Neckers wandered back to the buses. It was a nice walk back to the entrance, and it is amusing to see what some people get excited about (tiny lizard or spider), but I was looking forward to checking out the walking tracks, and as they were all closed there was nothing to do except check out the dodgy souvenir shop.

It is an amazing experience. At times you will be quite close, within a few feet from the Orangutans. You quickly discover that you are not only observing them, they are equally observing you.The one annoyance I had was, that if an orangutan was close by, fellow tourists would not move on to allow others to have ample photo opportunity. It would be ideal, in this situation if the staff asked people to move on after they had taken their photos."

There is the opportunity to watch a video about what the sanctuary actual does to help the animals, and I strongly recommend watching this video which is truly moving and often shocking. There is then the opportunity to see feeding times, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. It is definitely worth going to the afternoon feeding time which is when there are less tourists and visiting 10-15 minutes before the actual feeding time will guarantee you a good place and probably the chance to see the Orang-Utans when they are not intimidated by the tourists. I would have liked to see more of the baby or younger Orang-Utans after watching the video in the morning or being able to get a little closer to them.

Apart from the feedings there's not much to do (the walking tracks were closed), my advice would be to spend more of your time at the rainforest discovery centre and go to the afternoon feeding as that was when most of the orangutans came to feed."

We got to see 3 orang-utans but they didn't hang around for that long. The platform was also pretty far from where they were so picture opportunities were limited. You have to remember that it is a rehabilitation sanctuary and the purpose of it is to encourage the orang-utans to stay in the wild and look for their own food. They just provide food for those that want it. It was an experience but we wouldn't go back. We much preferred the proboscis monkey experience.

Even though these particular orang utans are here because of their dependency on humans, there can be no guarantees of how many you may see on any given day.  Within the space of our 90 minute visit, however, we were lucky enough to see 9, including 2 mothers nursing babies.  Mostly they were about 20 feet away from our large viewing area on another, feeding platform.  They started arriving via thick ropes and cables from about 30 minutes before food was distributed.  After feeding, several of them descended on to the boardwalk so that at times we were only 2 or 3 feet away from them.  Although not part of our reason for being here, a large troupe of macaques also came by to clean up any left-overs.Staying next door enabled us to watch the afternoon feeding which is apparently far quieter than the morning session when coach loads of tourists descend, many of them flying in from Kota Kinabulu on a day trip.  Ths is worth knowing since even in the afternoon there were around 50 people actually viewing, many of whom were clearly just ticking off another item on their bucket list, others with small children who became fractious after only a few minutes.  Too many showed precious little regard for the SILENCE notices prominently displayed, treating it more like a zoo than a wildlife experience.  This is the only reason for not giving the attraction the highest rating: as ever, wiki animals can teach humans a lot about grace and dignity."

When we arrived our guide spotted an orang utan standing between two trees. People sitting right by had not even noticed they were being observed! The orang utan then climbed up onto the roof of the reception centre and sat for about 15 minutes, posing obligingly for photos. He seemed most interested in us - maybe working out if he could grab a bag off someone, I don't know. Then when we all filed into the rainforest towards the viewing platform our guide pointed out a mother & baby high up in a tree waiting patiently for the rangers to bring out the food. It was awesome to watch her with the baby. Then the show started - the food was put out, and gradually orang utans of various ages emerged from the forest, swinging on trees or along ropes provided to the food platform. It was just amazing to watch these animals - we had so much fun. I would highly recommend taking a powerful zoom lens, or binoculars to study their interactions and antics more closely, as they have so much character.

Then we were told we had to pay an extra RM10 per camera - come on, just include this in the entry fee. On a positive note we did see about six orang utans. On the flight in, you can easily see what the main problem is for the poor orang utans - their habitat is still being destroyed to plant palm oil trees, so ugly.

Do not go here if you want to get close to the animals, you will not be allowed to touch them and have to stay on a platform and allow the animals to continue with their meal in peace.

It's kind of fun watching them and I hope the funds from tickets are being used to help them and it's more than a tourist attraction.Be also prepared for macaques as they appear at the walkboard.

There is no apology made for the trails being closed and no offer of a reduced price so we paid the 30rm per foreign person (compared to 5rm per Malaysian person) and stayed for about an hour to watch the orangutans be fed in the man made area, so it was basically like going to the zoo.

After trying the local bus, we took the driver option the next day!! The local bus was definitely way cheaper, however it took an hour to get there, no taxis were around for the 2km walk off the main road (there or back) so alot of walking in the heat!! Also we didn't know the distances very well and were misinformed on distances. Be smart........... take a driver!The centre is well organised. Yes you pay more as a tourist, l don't mind this fact and the money goes to a good cause anyway.Also yes there is an extra 10ringett charge for the camera ($3 in our terms) who wouldn't pay $3 to get the photos and video!!We went to the afternoon feed and there was heaps of room to move around and see everything."

Unfortunately, the walking trails were still closed at the time.For Malaysians, it's RM5 per adult for admission and RM10 per camera. Do make use of the locker facility to store your bags as the more curious and mischievous orang utan may try to grab them.We saw four juvenile semi-wild orang utan at the 10 am feeding session that morning. The orang utan did not appear to be that hungry - that could mean good news as they must be able to source for food in the jungle. They were fed milk (which they seemed to favour and that was finished in no time) and fruits.It is interesting to watch the orang utan's antics, but in comparison, we prefer the experience at Semenggoh Orang Utan Rehabilitation Centre near Kuching - where we saw 10 orang utan of various age group including a baby, and how an orang utan breaks open and consume a coconut."

Extra MYR10 to bring a camera in; and then it got me thinking - what about camera phones? That aside, this place is tailor-made for tourists. It's relatively safe; keepers everywhere - it's a matter of luck if you'd be able to see the Orang Utans up close. At times, they wouldn't go even remotely close to the food hut. A mellow experience for me, don't expect a wild ""zoo experience"" - you're most likely unable to interact with the monkeys. Helpful tips: Lower your voice when the Orang Utans emerge as loud noises tend to scare them away. Wear comfortable shoes as lots of walking involved to the platform. Do not litter. When taking pictures, turn off the flash - the Orang Utans are very camera shy and are timid creatures."

My dream come true!We were then amazed after a short 10 minutes, by up to a dozen Orangutans from tiny to huge who came to feed on the platform. A few of them even came down amongst the humans to investigate!Of course we are ushered away from them as remember these are semi-wild animals and can be unpredictable and dangerous if prevoked!The only thing I wish is that I had done this independantly and stayed in a lodge close to the centre so I could make more than one trip to the centre. As part of the tour we were only there approx 2 hours which in my opinion was not long enough!!One tip I would give is to take a sun hat,a small towel  and bottle of water as you may have to stand out on the viewing platform for sometime and the heat is unbelievable and exhausting (especially in August when the humidity is also about 80%) Take a good camera to zoom in and some binoculars so you can see high up into the trees."

This place is a home for about 30 orphans orangutans who are being rehabilitated into the wild in a natural but protected setting. They usually stay for about 6 years at this sanctuary but are essentially living in the wild. There are also babies borne in captivity that are also prepared for the wild. It was interesting to note that 96.4% of their DNA is similar to that of humans. They catch the same sicknesses as humans so washing our hands was a must upon entering.  We arrived at the 10:00 am feeding. Suddenly out of nowhere the orangutans arrived crawling down ropes to the feeding platform. You really don't know how many orangutans arrive for the feeding so everyday is quite different. Get there early as there are lots of people. It is amazing seeing the orangutans climbing in on the vines to the feeding station. We were fortunate to see Toby, Melaka and her baby Charlie and 2 others.They really are entertaining. We spend time watching them feed and swinging and hanging on the vines. Suddenly many short tailed macaques arrived which were also very entertaining. Bring you cameras and binoculars.

The only positive I might say is that it gave us an opportunity to view these primates fairly closely and get a few photos of them - the sanctuary demands RM10 if you want to take your camera in to the area - we felt that this was a ripoff as we had already paid our admission.

This is a nice story but its not why people visit to hear this gentleman speak, and considering he speaks only in English with no malay, there were a few local visitors clearly annoyed with this cultural backhand. They then show a video which is far more interesting befoer everyone scrambles to get their shoes back on and rush to the feeding platforms.  With a total of three of four Orangutans, there¬¥s about 1 for every 30 tourists - they are amazing creatures but when you struggle to see them over cameras, iphones and whinging children, the exprience of seeing them is not so amazing.

No adult orang, only youngsters and the closest you are to them is when they climb out along the overhead cables. They need to be kept such a distance from us because our diseases can kill.

The first had about 5 and the second 8 along with quite a few macaques. Both sessions are the same which involves the ""keeper"" giving them fruit and milk. It was a really great experience to see them relatively close up and then to see them really wild in the jungle. The boardwalk was quite short and most of it was closed which we didnt know before the visit so that was disappointing. Between feeds you can walk to the RDC and do the canopy walk. It takes about 20 mins to walk here. There is a small cafe at both. We adopted Bella!"

The viewing platform is vast - large enough to cope with al least three bus loads and the time table of the big tours encourages enough time to get pictures to impress the folks back home so the platform surges with noisy chatty people waiting to take a picture then ... nothing.We used a taxi which enables us to look through the other exhibits Costs more but less rush

There was plenty of action but I was surprised at how quiet the are when eating.  Afternoon 7 turned up and again plenty of action.  This time because there were 4 adults and 3 teenagers there was more interaction and some noise over the food.  Well worth a visit.  The centre is very well run and clean with plenty of parking.

Otherwise you can book various tours from Sandakan for mor money direct. The Bus goes right to the park, where you will pay entrance fee of RM 30/15 for adults/children, plus RM 10 camera fee, we never saw anyone pay mor e for longer lenses! You can get a free locker to put all your bags and stuff in, we would recommend you bring a towel from your hotel to wipe the sweat off periodically as it was smoking hot on the walkways! We wet ours down in the washroom and just wrapped it around our neck, and only took our cameras in. You walk down wooden walkways to the platform area, and will see the orangutans coming down the ropes when they know it is time to feed. No need for bug spray, maybe put sunscreen on before you go, but it was muggy, not really direct sun. The were a lot of macaque monkeys around that are not shy and will crawl all over the viewing areas, they were above and below us all the time so be patient for pictures! There were more orangutans during the morning feed we went to, but were told this varies daily. Then we walked about 1km back down the road to the forest reserve and wandered around there all day for RM 15 pp, which had lovely canopy walks and plants & flowers, though oddly enough we saw no wildlife, then made our way back to the afternoon feeding of the orangutans before catching the bus back to Sandakan. Should we have been more pressed for time, there are cabs and shuttles in the parking lot you can hire to take you to the Proboscis monkey reserve less than half hour away, and be back here for the afternoon feeding. Otherwise you will need to take a tour bus or taxi there separately, and it is quite expensive but definitely worthwhile as well, as we returned rom both with hundreds of monkey pictures!"

There was an orangutan hanging out when we got there and then 5 more orangutans turned up for feeding time. It was nice to see them up close as you don't get to see them that close in the wild (we did manage to see them in the wild) and we liked that they were not too close to the platform so had their space. Unfortunately the nature trails were all closed so there was nothing to do afterwards, but wait for our transport. Definitely recommended!"

Sepilok does wonderful work and we were very lucky to see 9 urang-utans at the feeding platform and another two up close in the visitors car park where they are not really supposed to be (but it's not a zoo, there are no barriers and they can go whereever they want!)We visited Sepilok as part of a day trip from KK.

Given that  all the Orangs are rescue animals  we did not expect  a true wild experience ,however all the Orangs are free to roam and only return to the sanctuary at feeding times. Over time they are being weaned from human contact and returned to the wild. The information and video at the sanctuary  are very good as is the opportunity to see Orangs up close. If visiting take a telephoto lens as the feeding stage is a reasonable distance from the public viewing platform. We saw about 8 Orangs on each visit and this whetted our appetite for the wild Orangs we were to see later in the Kinabatangan area of Sabah. It would be a shame to miss out on this educational chance to prepare for the truly wild cousins up river.We also had the opportunity of a private guided night walk with an excellent ranger who took us along  sometimes crumbling boardwalks for an hour after dark. We met one of the Orangs along the way plus many other nocturnal animals from flying squirrels to spiders. This was a  real highlight and very inexpensive."

The centre is a wonderful wooden structure that blends in nicely with the rain forest, there they have the ticket office, video-education centre and souveneer shop. They supply a locker for your bags as the orangutans get curious sometimes and a bag snatched by an ape is difficult to retrieve ! There is a board walk through the jungle to the viewing platform & out again, mabey 1 km all up, the platform is constructed so that everyone can see the apes. The number of orangutans to see can vary but we got lucky and saw 7 indivduals, adult and juvinile. You have to remember this is a rain forest so an umbrella is a good idea. We did the morning session to enjoy the relative cool morning air. The boardwalk is slippery when damp so sensible shoes are a must as is insect repelent. the walk through the jungle is wonderful, full of birds & butterflies.

Having to pay to take a camera in (RM10) is a bit of a cheek on top of the RM30 entrance fee!  The only disappointment about the whole operation is the lack of policing there is on the noise level on the viewing platform.

Other than having my camera equipment stolen (my own fault I guess), it felt more like a Zoo and a ploy for cash than an actual Rehabilitation Centre.Firstly, there is a lengthy video that you watch before going to see the Orangu-tans. The purpose of the video is to show you why you should consider sponsoring an Organgutan. While I am all for supporting animals, I found this a bit cheeky and quite a guilt trip.There was no actual viewing of any Orangutan's being rehabilitated. Only a walk to a platform where you could see wild Orangutan's come down to have a feed. With about 80 people on the platform, taking pictures was difficult and also the shear volume of people on the tour that day probably made it quite intimidating for them to come down and play. I saw more squirrels than Orangutans."

The place is in the middle of the rainforest so it is the natural habitat of orangutans and many other endangered species. Enterence fee goes directly to orangutans. Sepilok center encourages the native Malaysian people to save the rainforests. Otherwise they can easily destroy the rainforests for palm plantation. They have to know that they can make a fortune by saving orangutans and jungles. For me it was a kind of necessity to go there.I took public bus number 14 from Sandakan, it was 5MYR, on the way back i walked to the junction a mini tourist van just stopped and i got in, it was 7MYR. So my trip was reasonable. If you want to see more touristic orangutan rehabilitation center, i would recommend Taiping, 3 hours drive from K.Lumpur. It is like an island zoo. You can see the babies as well.I like the place, the jungle was impressive."

A couple of them were really putting on a show for the tousits and it was hilarious.We came back at the 3pm feed and it was comparitively subdued.  There were no antics from the orangutans and fewer than there were in the morning.  If you don't get a good 'show' at the 10am session, I recommend returning for the 3pm show as you never know what you're going to get.I understand some of the reviewers were disappointed that the orangutans were mostly far away, but like the concept that we walk on an elevated platform and not on the ground in their envirnment.  The point of the sanctuary is to rehabilitate orangutans and introduce them to some independence, so I think it's essential that humans keep their distance. Tourists are given the advice on numerous occasions NOT to bring in water, sunglasses etc.  There are free lockers to put them in.  Many people ignored these requests.  One man had his Ray Bans snatched off his head, chewed up and literally spat back out at him.  As entertaining as it was that one came up to us, she could have cut her mouth on his sunglasses, or been poisoned by someone's sunscreen bottle.  Please respect the wishes of the park staff and don't bring those items in.Also, don't come with an expectation of getting up close and personal, it's about what the orangutans need for their rehab, not what we might want to see or do with them."

Unfortunately only 1 trail was open (the one leading to the feeding platform) and was 600 meters long... so really it looked more like a zoo than a natural park...if you are around fine but not worth the extra mile."

The first time we came, we missed the feeding times(which only last for around 30 minutes each) and hence were not allowed to enter because the orang-utans only show up during the feeding times.

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 6 December 2012,Friends,A visit to Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation centre is a life transformation experience.The rehabilitation centre has been beautifully created in a natural wild life environment to nurture old; injured or orphaned Orangutans.Borneo rainforest has  Dipterocarp trees & Koompassia excelsa (above 80m tall) some of the tallest tropical trees in the world.With their long arms and legs only the orangutans can climb and reside at such stratospheric heights. Sadly the timber logging industry has ravaged Borneo rainforest to just 4% of the total land mass. And the forest has been replaced by Palm tree cultivation. Malaysia is one of the largest exportes of Palm oil. Its disgusting to see how the most selfish and pathetic creatures in this planets the humans have destroyed the natural habitat of these wonderful near human like peaceful animals.The visitors are shown a video and then one gets to see the orangutans have a safe and secure environment to live peacefully. These orangutans walk around casually and one can encounter them in very close quarters. There is a beautiful viewing gallery where one can witness them being fed during feeding time. There are many young orphaned little ones adopted by the centre after their parents have been killed.It just breaks your heart to see these cute little ones. Its a must visit as one learns to be a lot more sensitive to nature and the animals in the wild.  .

You find them sitting in trees by the giftshop or in the eaves of the roof to shelter from the sun.Make sure you take a big SD card for your camera as you will take lots.

Allow enough time before feeding to put your belongings   In the lockers provided as no bags , food etc are allowed in for a good reason.  . Cameras of course are ok and there is a small camera fee . As we were staying at the lovely Sepilok Jungle Resort , a 5 - 10 min walk we booked onto  the 2 hour guided night walk. SORC. By night is quite different but highly recommend this and the fee was reasonable and thrilling .. Our guide was knowledgable about the night life and where to locate it .He carried a good spotlighting torch and we also had one . If you do the night walk it is great to take your own night spotting torch too . During our walk which was mostly on boards walks we saw a owl perched on the side of a tree , slow loris , numerous frogs , centipedes , giant ants , Squirrel , 5 green Waglers  pit vipers , kingfishers and my highlight was the Malay Badger who was searching for food right next to the board walk . So if you are planning to come to SORC  then don't just jump on a bus for a quick visit stay at Sepilok for day and night wildlife spotting and also visit The Rainforest Discovery Centre  about 20 -  30 minutes walk but well worth it .

Just us humans watching orangutans have a meal and observing their antics. A rogue orangutan came to the car park at the end of the morning session to walk around to watch the humans as well.

Top points for all who run this place it is a real treasure. I refuse to support zoos and such but it really is quite an amazing experience to watch these beautiful animals. We then did the night walk - and would definately rate it the best in the whole of Borneo - our local ranger /guide was an expert in every way. We saw a stack of amazing wildlife and learnt lots.Thank you!!!"
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 1 November 2012,,It is not a zoo and you do need to be prepared to not see any orang utans however from what I have heard you will generally see at least one or two and not seeing them means they are close to being fully rehabilitated. We were very lucky 5 adults and a baby graced us on the day we visited also on the walk to the feeding platform a female greet a tour group in front of us and proceeded to walk along the hand rail for about 20 meters so we had a very close encounter. The work that is being done at the centre is fantastic they are running a very successful program. Make sure you watch the video presentation to get a behind view of what they are trying to accomplish. Also if you can afford it any donations or sponsorship really helps continue the great work. We sponsored one for 180 MR. It's a good idea to wear sunscreen and insect repellant and as many people have mentioned it is very hot on the feeding platform so have a good drink before you go into the park. There is a cafe and clean toilets there as well as lockers for your belongings which looks very safe. You will be charged 10 MR for each camera you take into the park but its worth it! I hope you enjoy this experience as much as we did.

The viewing area for the orangutan feeding session is nice as its surrounded with big trees and lots of different species of plants. You can get lucky seeing a monkey at cross proximity before you reach the viewing area as some of the monkeys would come out from out of nowhere and start dangling at the trees around you. An hour at this place is enough to be able to view the Oranagutans. Children and adults will enjoy. Make sure you bring a good camera that has a sling as they give a warning of monkeys taking lose things from tourists.

We thought we'd be able to walk at our own pace around the rest of the centre after the ""show"" but we were quickly hurried on by impatient keepers. The job they do is without a doubt fantastic but it's all very staged and doesn't hold a light to seeing these beautiful creatures in the wild (which is possible if you're patient and lucky).Other than the feeding display there's very little to do here, certainly not a full day out I was expecting."

I must say though that we had just spent the previous two days in the jungle and were privileged enough to see these creatures at there best...in the wild. This unfortunately made seeing them here a little disappointing although its a great place and the work the rehabilitation centre undertakes is to be commended. We were very impressed with the large trees as its rare to see the rainforest at its best....before logging has cut it back. Worth a visit to see orangutans up close. Don't stress if you coming straight from the airport as they have huge lockers to store your luggage.

This is a rehabilitation centre whose aim is to rehome these lovely animals back to the wild, yes by paying an entrance fee, we have expectations but I was happy with watching the Orangs for more than an hour. My suggestion wait around after the crowds move on and you will get uninterrupted views and more time with these lovely creatures. Once the feeding was over we watched the movie and read all the information that was on hand...very informative and unfortunately all the walking trails were closed.A suggestion to improve the facility would be to have guides available for discussions and questions prior to and during the feeding."

We didn't worry about long sleeves and pants (the kids couldn't cope with the heat) and just overdosed on Bushman's repellant! It would be great to be able to get a bit closer to the orangutans but I understand why that's not possible as they are being prepared for return to the wild. Stay as long as possible after the orangutans finish feeding as the macaque monkeys come down next and they are hilarious to watch. Hopefully in future they will allow views of the nursery and jungle-gym area for the babies as this would have been great to see. Excellent work being done by the UK-based Orangutan Appeal.

We were rewarded with 15 minutes of watching a young orangutan sitting on the handrail within reach of the small number of people who also came early and chose to wander around and not plant themselves directly in front of the feeding platform. Such a unique opportunity which is one of our Malaysian highlights.The video presentation by the UK charity group is also very moving and informative and can be enjoyed after the morning feeding session."

During the time I visited, there were squirrels, a monkey and 2 orangutans feeding on the same barrel of fruits.  It's interesting to see that everyone seemed to know the rules of the game, orangutan eats first and the little ones would wait anxiously on the side.  Also saw the hierarchy and social interaction among orangutans too.  Too bad we didn't have time to visit the entire facility to learn more about the animal.

Try to avoid Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays when the locals come with the abundace as well (they have much cheaper tickets). No chance to see real wild orangutans but only some juveniles from the Centre brought by rangers.

We stayed down the road (I have also reviewed that place) and there was a free shuttle service to the Centre.  There are two feeding times and I'd read that the morning one can be very busy but in fact neither were unmanageable at all - you could see from the viewing platform, easily.Unfortunately there had apparently been a bear sighting recently and so the walking paths were closed so we didn't have so much to do between feedings, other than sit out in the sunshine.  The video was definitely worth a watch and we had a wander round their 'history' type section with interesting information on the local wildlife.  After the second feeding, on the way back from the viewing platform, we had an up close and personal moment with one of the young orangutans who literally walked along the railings of the boardwalk, so came within a metre of us.  A slightly daunting moment but he was harmless - he tried to snatch a camera off a lady who firmly said 'no' to him in a typical mother type way and he happily continued on his way!A definitely must see when going to Borneo, highly recommended and I challenge anyone to leave without adopting a baby orangutan, they're just too cute - but do note, there's a * to confirm that you are not able to dictate how the animal is brought up!!!

It is worth staying around when they have finished eating and the staff leave the feeding platform as it is fun to see the macaques 'hot wire' it down one after another to the platform to feed on the scraps. We saw a family of about 30! They are very mischievous and fascinating to watch.The centre closes at lunchtime for two hours and there is not much to do there except watch the 30min video. We walked down the road (20min walk) to the Discovery centre and did the canopy walk (RM10) which is a good way to fill the time- even if most of the wildlife hide in the midday sun!

We were with teenage kids and they loved it. There are very helpful volunteers that make sure the young kids get to the front and see as much as they can, the video afterwards (in reception) is also worth seeing for the background.

4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 12 September 2012,,"A visit to the Sepilok Orangutan Sanctuary is a good way to see orangutans up close with minimal effort, which is great if you are travelling with young kids or are unable to do any of the jungle trekking tours.As noted by other reviewers, the Sanctuary does feel like a cross between a conservation park and a zoo. It is a great experience to be able to see these wonderful animals up-close, even if it is a 'staged' environment with the feeding platform and rangers present. The orangutans and the other animals (monkeys, possums, etc) are free to move as they please - it is the humans who are confined to the walkways - and depending on the time of year the orangutans may not even come down to feed if there is enough native food available in the jungle. However, the large noisy crowds all jostling for the best viewing position and the old, stony-faced expatriate volunteer 'ranger' barking at the crowd to stay quiet (which seemed a tad ironic) does lessen the experience.Reducing the number of people at each feeding session would definitely improve the 'visitor experience', but as facilities such as this one rely on funding generated by visitor numbers it is a difficult balance to achieve.If you are looking for a chance to see orangutans in their natural habitat then it is worth a visit to Sepilok. However, if you are planning a trip to Sandakan only to see the orangutans and you have limited time on your hands you might think about instead going to the orangutan sanctuary at the Shangri-la Rasa Ria Hotel outside Kota Kinabalu, which is associated with the Sepilok Sanctuary and has a similar set-up. It also has a jungle canopy walking tour which you can do after seeing the orangutans or as a separate day/night activity.Ultimately, any opportunity to see orangutans in their natural environment (or as close to it as possible) is something that should not be missed."

As part of a tour we were able to watch a feeding at 10am.  There are no fences so the Orangutans can come and go as they please.  Luckily or unluckily one of them decided to venture out into the crowds. Although this was a wonderful photo opportunity, I felt a little sad and scared for the Orangutan as the tourists were crowding around them and not allowing them to move around easily.  Ultimately I believe that this is a wonderful place and the good that they are doing by trying to rehabilitate orphaned Orangutans is amazing.

So it's not really a criticism to say I was disappointed, because I can't see how they can do it any other way. But I was disappointed nonetheless. The whole point of going to Borneo for us was to see the Orang Utans, but although they say these ones are semi-wild, it just feels like feeding time at the zoo. You see a video, take a short boardwalk through the jungle and then arrive at a huge viewing platform where a European woman carries a sign saying Silence in a way reminiscent of that bloke in Piccadilly Circus who carried a sign saying the end of the world was nigh. Lordy lord, there were a lot of people on that viewing platform. To begin with we were just watching macaques, the sort that you see in documentaries about animal experiments on primates, and then just as you're getting a teensy bit bored, the rangers turn up with some buckets of food and the orangs swing out of the jungle on cue to tuck in. But the ranger sits on the platform next to the orangs, so it doesn't feel any different from feeding time at London Zoo, and then on the walkway back again at the end, lo and behold there's one of the orangs walking along the handrail. They just don't seem very wild.There's a mini-version of the set-up at the Rasa Ria resort in Kota Kinabalu and I don't think you miss out by seeing it all there. Best of all of course is to head into the jungle and see the wild ones for real. You may not see them so close up, but at least they feel real."

We were a bit surprised at the per camera charge and opted for one but I later realised I had my iPhone in my pocket and used that as a camera.  We had no problem with Malaysian nationals being charged less for entry, it's all relative and their cost of living is very different to ours (we're not wealthy westerners either, we're on a really tight budget).  The locker system for bags is safe.It was a little unclear what we were to do once we paid the entry fee, people were milling around uncertainly, so we headed down the boardwalk and were rewarded by seeing three big orangutans just hanging out on the side railing, very close.  It was wonderful.  They then swung up into the trees and hung around for a while. Apparently the morning group saw only one orangutan so we were very lucky.  They make it very clear that you take your chances and might see lots or none.  Fair enough as the orangutans are free to come and go as they please.At first the lady waving the sign and shouting ""silence please"" was vaguely annoying but later I realised it was necessary. our group was mostly respectful and quiet but there were a few who chattered loudly constantly and little kids who ran and shouted. I spoke to that lady later, and she explained that we are the intruders. The orangutans are not there for our amusement. Highly intelligent animals, I'm quite sure they get sick of being gawked at every day so the least we can do is be respectfully quiet.It was a great privilege to see these marvellous creatures up close. At feeding time the view was excellent and everyone was able to see. We were lucky to have three orangutans including a mother and her baby come to the feeding. People who complain about not being able to hold a baby orangutan are missing the point entirely.The sanctuary is doing great work rehabilitating displaced orangutans.  Yet another example of the Malaysian commitment to conservation and preservation."

A ticket is valit the full day. Same for the camera fee (10RM).The first visit we saw two Orang utans in the trees on the way to the viewing platform and two at the platform from 9:45 to 10:30AM. The orang utans could not been seen very well. It was a little bit a disappointment. When we arrived at the platform for the second time (2:22PM) one orang utan was standing on the railing on the platform. For 17 minutes we watch each other, only several meters apart. From 2:50 to 3:40PM we saw three orang utans plus a baby orang utan. This visit was the opposite of a disappointment.The next morning we saw first the video (worth to see if you have time). At the platform we saw between 9:50 and 10:30AM three orang utans. Again a little bit a disappointment. At the way back we met a group of macaque. Some of them were very aggressive.I think the afternoon visit is better because the number of tourist was far less then both times in the morning. The walking trails around the platform other than the main route where closed.The viewing platform does not have a shelter. It will be wet when raining and hot when the sun shines. GPS 5.862899, 117.947936I prefer the visit to Labuk Bay Proboscis Monkey Sanctuary strongly above Sepilok Nature Resort because the number of animals was far larger and the view on them was better.

Too many people making too much noise and being bossed about by an self-important 'Honorary Warden'. Considering the forest is large the trail is about 300m. Pitiful exposure to the jungle. I went separately to the Rainforest Discovery Centre - no primates but a far more authentic experience. Saw wonderful Trogon birds and trekked through the manykilometres of jungle. And for 1/3 of the cost of the Orang Utan rehab centre. It's great what they are doing to preserve the orang Utan from the ravages of man but this place was not an uplifting experience. If you really want a good experience then hire a guide for a night safari (20RM per person for an hour). That was fascinating and we saw far more - the place was deserted and most of the insects are nocturnal anyway.

Our first visit we saw two, one stayed with his back to the crowd who were loud and screaming, the other decided to mingle a little in the crowd which caused some issues with people crowding even more. We also managed to see monkeys on the way out which was fun. The other two visits we saw more Orangutans which was excellent but again the crowding around the animal can be upsetting for some. We would however wholeheartidly recommend the night walks here. We were able to do two, and saw 2 orangutans, flying squirrels, vipers, spiders, scorpions, sloth and Civet.

All bags, water bottles have to be stowed away in free lockers provided but be weary of the useless individual who will take 10 minutes to stow their belongings and not move out of the way even though they know you are waiting. The cafe after is so busy it's best to stand under a shady tree or you will get trampled over. The cost is $15 ringgit for a local but doubles for foreigners! With younger children best head to your local zoo for a much calmer, comfortable and pleasant experience. Oh by e way we only saw one organs hutan who kept her back to us for the entire time (cant say I blame her with all the tourist glaring at her) this is after the bigger tourist got borded and moved on.

Yes it's touristy but it's well worth a trip to see these amazing animals up close (I saw one in the wild but from further away). About 6 or 7 orang-utans made an appearance the afternoon I went (and that was in fruit season when the orangutans are able to feed more freely in the forest and therefore less likely to come to the platform for feeding). We saw the big male, a mother with a baby and few adolescents who played and fed on the ropes overhead. So a great viewing. What was annoying was all the noisy people at the viewing platform - especially those with kids who couldn't seem to keep them quiet and under control, threatening to scare away the animals. The afternoon session is much quieter than the morning (when the tour buses visit). And it's easy to visit on your own - it's an easy 45 min taxi from Sandakan (40RM there + 40RM return + 20RM waiting fee = 100RM all up + 30RM entry fee). No need to join a tour group.

Be prepared if you go in June it IS hot and humid in the centre and as you cant take water out to the platforms to view the orangutangs make sure you are hydrated before you head out as you are out in the sun for quite awhile, but its worth it. We had a large crowd there when we went but everyone was in awe when the orangutangs come down the ropes to the platforms for the food, you are fairly close to them at this point so a camera with a say 15x zoom is adequate .Make sure you go into the information room at the centre if you want any sort of info on the place though as there is no actual commentary or presentation given while you are viewing the orangutangs which is perhaps one area they might improve on for the education of people of why they need these rehab places .I loved the experience."

Some of this is luck but the older age profile, longer tenure and laudable goal of pushing animals back into the forest reserve make viewing more risky than at the younger, shorter tenure option where monkeys are more dependent upon feeding.

If on the other hand you can go deeper into the rain forrest then i recommend the Dannum valley lodge where you hike around the forest trails to see the orangs rather than wait for them to visit a feeding station. Having been lucky enough to go to both Dannum valley and the Kinabatangan river for a week this felt a little bit like a zoo which sounds really awful but the whole experience was totally different. On a tour you are probably on your own as a couple with a guide whereas at Sepilok you stand around on decking with about 100 other people.

We enjoyed watching the feed (Orang Utans and macaques both turn up for this), though it does feel a little fake. For me, this was a good opportunity to watch the monkeys for a good while, but catching a short glimpse of a wild Orang Utan elsewhere on Borneo was more rewarding."

We had two viewings from the polatforms looking onto the feeding lofts.  Each time 3 to 4 orangs came, once a mother with baby, and once a whizzened strong male.  You will also see macaques.  I had always presumed the orangs do not have access to people; not true.  One younger male came onto the platforms, circled serveral times, posed; but always under the mindful eye of the ranger."

Staying just round the corner,we were able to visit this place four times (once at night). Eachtime the atmosphere was slightly different, cooler and more active after a rain shower, busy in the morning (when the tours come in) and just a little bit spooky at night. There is a noticeable difference in numbers between the mornings and afternoons and for this reason we preferred the quieter afternoons. I think the Orangutans did too, there were much more at ease during these feeding periods. On the first afternoon one climbed up on the ropes above us and layed there watching us as we watched them...a fantastic experience...Our friends even had one Orangutan come out of the forest next to them and walk right passed them. A very special place and worth more than one visit."

Tickets bought (camera has to be paid separately) allow you to visit both morning feeding and afternoon feeding which is very good since sometimes only one orangutan can appear. If you have time do not forget to watch a document about sanctuary work as well. Most of the accommodation around ensure transportation to the park. Probably the closest accommodation is Sepilok Jungle Resort but it is more expensive. I would recommend Uncle¬¥Tan accommodation which was 100 ringits (april 2012) per night per room,  three very good meals included. Rainforest Discovery Centre is also worth to see it."

You have to remember that there are no guarantees they will show for the feedings, though, and this is probably a good thing.  It means they are finding food on their own, which is the whole point of the center.  We seem to have seen the same mother and baby that the last few reviewers did.  A single female and a couple of macaques rounded out the show.  It was fun to watch the singleton take a swipe with his hand at an annoying macaque.  The mother with baby departed right over our heads, affording ample photo opportunities."

As Orangutans are attracted to shiny objects, food and handbags you will given a locker to safely stow your valuables before entering the park. The park itself has well maintained walkways surrounded both sides by jungle. You will be sure to see monkeys, which are very entertaining in themselves. The Orangutans are a wild card, as they are being rehabilitated to fend for themselves. You may see many or in our case one. It depends on the day and what delicacies they can find in the jungle for themselves.

The down side is the nature on the experience does depend on how many noisy children and tourists there are about, as it was very crowded in the afternoon. The 30RM ticket allows you to go throughout the day so you can attend both the morning and afternoon feedings which is good. However, this place could so easily be improved by updating the visitors centre and all of the literature (all hopelessly out of date) and giving more information about the rehabilitation of the animals. Apart from the platforms there is little to keep visitors interested and more importantly to persuade them to part their money to help preserve this endangered species. A small amount of improvement would make a big difference."

A TV (smaller than in most homes) at a low level in the front of an odd shaped room with a snack bar made it difficult to see and hear.  I‚Äôd recommend taking the TV out of the TV stand and putting it on top of the stand so that it projects further back in the room.  Also, maybe close the snack bar during showings.  Oh, and ask staff not to chitchat amongst themselves during the showing.  This is a great undertaking and we happily supported it.  Camera fee is nominal and worth it.

Block out everyone else and remind yourself why you are there.We saw three orang utans. One on his own and then a mum and baby. I am not sure if it was because there was a baby but the feeders placed all the food behind the tree stump. As a result we saw nothing but the mum's back! it would have made sense for the food to be placed on the side where the visitors were???All in all I was pleased I went because I saw the orangutans.

Also if you arrive late for the first feeding - they let us go in and have a look to see if there were still some around.

The orangutangs you can see are those that have been released but are still coming back for food assistance.  So you could conclude that the best thing for the orangutangs is that you see none (meaning that they are doing ok without assistance).  We saw one mom and her baby and it was fun but we didn't see much more than we eventually did on the Kinabatangan in the wild.

The highlight was definitely the night walk which you must sign up for at the ticket desk earlier in the day and costs RM20 pp. Our guide was excellent and showed us so much - snakes; a slow loris; fire flies; insects and we were so lucky to have a young Orang Utan come and hang out around our group (within a metre of us all) for about 15 minutes.

It would have been good if they had left one or two open for visitors to enjoy. Also, they close the ticket office for an hour at lunch - there's a man sat behind the counter but he can't for some reason sell tickets until 2pm, so probably best to try and arrive either before 1pm or after 2pmHighlights were the beautiful orangutan we were lucky enough to see, and the heaps of macaque monkeys who were very entertaining while we waited"

Forced to store our belongings in the lockers, and get rid of our water bottles --- it was 35* on the purpose built viewing platform. Upon first sight of a strategically placed orang-utan we were hurried along so that more people could be crammed into the 'authentic jungle environment'.HOWEVER, we did the orang-utans. They are beautiful and we got some excellent pictures of them eating and playing. We were just saddened that the whole experience felt so inauthentic: we could drive along to Chester Zoo in the UK and see something very similar, yet here we were in the Borneo jungle watching a feeding show.I'm sure it's an excellent experience for families and those who don't venture into the wilds often, but if you're out for a unique adventure; you won't find it here."

The afternoon session was quieter. We saw mother and child and some teenagers. Really nice. One came up to the boardwalk and some idiot wanted to take a picture standing next to the urang utan, somthe rangers came to take away the urang utan as it is dangerous for the urang utan to be too close to humans (wrg to diseases etc)? It is very hot in the jungle, and you spend a bit of time in there so quite sweaty!"

3.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 2 April 2012,Solo,"It's nice to see Orang-Utans, but they are fairly dosile creatures in the wild and don't do very much for the majority of the time. The Orang-Utan sanctuary at feeding time is the best place to see them therefore.Expect to spend an hour waiting in the heat and humidity, and at some feeding times for only one Orang Utun to turn up, and then spend all the time eating with their back to you. The feeding platform is also quite some distance away.Plan to for 1 or 2 days and visit 2 or 3 feeding times (morning and afternoon) if you want to guarantee seeing anything. Also if you want good photos you'll need a good camera with a big lens, as lighting conditions are not ideal for photography. A Nikon D300 DSLR with a 80-400mm will work well. A Nikon 18-200mm VR lens is just not fast enough or big enough to get good close-up pictures when the opportunity arises!!"

My girlfriend and I came for the 1st one at 10..it was rainy and it looks like they brought out a ""stunt"" monkey to attract other monkeys..which worked, one more came with a baby.  Wasn't too satisfied, but it was interesting.  So then we walked to the rain forest center, hiked around, saw more wildlife (you have to look carefully) and then returned for the afternoon feeding.  The afternoon feeding was a LOT better. The sun was shining and saw 3 moms, 3 baby's and another male.  It was great.

She ate some of the bananas provided, in competition with the cheeky monkeys. a bit later another female with a baby clinging to her swung in on the ropes from the tree tops. She settled to eat as well. We had a great position and were able to take plenty of photos and also watch them at the front of the platform.

They have boardwalks through the forest, and viewing platforms to watch the apes at pre-arranged feeding times. Unfortunately, it rained really heavily while we were there (no surprise - it is a rain-forest!!), so the wildlife (very sensibly) was reluctuant to come out from their shelters in the trees. Having said that, we did see two Orang-Utans at close quarters.One additional item to add. The Centre is being expanded to include a rehabilitaion centre for Sun Bears. This is still under development, and not yet open to the public. However, we managed to get a ""sneak preview"" and it looks fascinating. Also, nearby is the recently constructed ""Rainforest Discovery Centre"". This is open to the public, and has impressive canopy walkways, as well as trails, gardens and a cafe.

You do not get to see the nursery or hospital or talk to the staff - just watch a BBC video and view the organutan at feeding time.

I do accept that they have to maintain strict entry conditions, keeping feeding time etc. But I've got a very strong feeling that making sure that all foreign-looking people are properly charged 6 times more than locals is the only thing that really concerns administration. As soon as they collected money - nobody cares about anything. Those couple of hundreds locals who pays RM5 don't bother to keep silence. And ""rangers"" don't bother to impose a rule of silence. Children are running amok and screaming and what rangers doing? They're just smiling and playing with those running kids... So, noise was overwhelming, but nobody cared. No orangutans came and rangers finally shoved us away from the park. After all, we all dutifully paid our ""foreigners-fee"", and our bad luck that no animal would dare to come near that yelling bunch of locals who filled all platform. Is it not Park's duty to provide some order and comfort for the visitors? It was worst experience during the whole stay on Borneo."

The rangers have a real bond with the orangutans and this is special. Take a night walk with the rangers here it's a must. You do not see the other side of things  i.e the behind the scenes work on site which would be better. This was our first encounter we the orangutans and will never be forgotten."

A tour guide's hint was to go in the afternoon, so this is mine to you as well. HOwever, the survival of the orangutans is paramount, so they should control the numbers of people going to the feeding platform. Tough luck if you are guest number 51, it is not about you. I would suggest limiting the age to over 10, as the toddlers and little children were bored a quickly started nagging and getting the way as they were running around. Bad Mommy and Daddy!

After reading so many mixed reviews online we were worried we may be contributing to what is little more than a petting zoo for orangutans. However after much research we decided on Sepilok to fulfil a dream of seeing Organutans in their natural habitat (well almost at least).We were very pleasantly surprised. The public are only allowed into the sanctuary for 1 hour in the morning and 1 hour in the afternoon, to one location on a viewing platform. Prior to entry there is a talk and a film about the work the sanctuary does and the terms to being allowed in to the forest. After being told to expect not to see any of the great apes as it was fruiting season and there is lots of food about - we were very privileged to see 2 mothers with their babies and a thrid pregnant orangutan! It was very special seeing them swing through the forest to the feeding platform, fairly oblivious to the crowd of people watching.What I really liked is that the animals are left, and encouraged, to be as wild as possible. Human contact is in no way encouraged and they are not there to put on a 'show' for the public. Patrons are not allowed into the rehabilitation unit at all or any contact with the orphaned orangutans. It is simply left to fate as to if the released apes fancy a bit of extra food in the day and come along to the feeding platform.The center seems to be doing really great work to spread the message about protecting the Orangutans in Malaysia and conservation and rehabilitation is taken very seriously. Our doubts and worries were definitely quashed and we had a very special and memorable experience watching the orangutans from a far in their forest."

I know it's not a zoo and pot luck but it was disappointing.It was extremely noisy from a group of Australian schoolgirls and some young Malaysian children, perhaps that had an impact. If so more should be done to keep people quiet.We waited after most people had left in case any others decided to come but sadly not. Then as we started to walk away we saw a young orang-utan walking towards us along the board-walk.

Based on the previous reviews and one of the hotel guests comments, I had lowered expectations of the Orang Utan Centre. They had a Malaysian Rate for the Orang Utan Centre - its RM 5 instead of RM 50 for non-Malaysians. For RM 5 and RM 10 (for cameras) it was fine - basically its 20-30 minutes of orang utan feeding at 10am and 3pm. When I was there I saw 2 orang utans clutching their babies having bananas an rambutans.  The orangutans were definitely worth the fees - I would feel differently if I were paying RM 50 though. The Orang Utan Centre also had some facilities such as - free lockers that can fit backpacks, a very clean air-conditioned toilet, an AV room and a basic display room for orangutan information. It also had a restaurant but it was a little overpriced - RM 6 (egg sandwhich ) RM 3.50 (iced coffee), RM 1-2 (hot coffee), RM 2 (mineral water).A few things though - you can't bring in water, bags into the rehabilitation centre as the orangutan may grab them. Since its the rainy season (Dec-Jan), they also sell ponchos for RM 5. In summary - I'm happy to have gone to Sepilok to see the orangutans at least once in my life as a Malaysian. For RM 5 admission + RM 10 camera  - it was worth it. For anything more, Im not sure  I would feel the same. It is more advisable to come over when its not the rainy season in Sandakan - as it was raining almost the whole day - all the guests ran for cover as the downpour came over us in the middle of the feeding."

Apparently some people can leave without seeing any, so we were happy. You can reuse your ticket in the afternoon if you dont see any in the morning.The one thing that did frustrate is remarks by tourists that it is like a zoo. You need to remember that these orangutans are being rehabilitated from often traumatic experiences with humans. This means that there is human interaction as they rely on the handlers for their food and to learn the skills that will help them to be set free.

However it is after this that you get to see what you came there for.You walk along a board walk in to the rainforest to a feeding area where there is a lot of place for numerous visitors to all be able to take amazing photos.  You get to be very close to them, and we had 3 females make their way along a rope just above the board walk.  I felt that you are able to get more than close enough to these amazing animals, and it is great to see them returend to a wild state.  2 of the females we saw had babies which shows the great work which goes on there.  It would be great to be able to see the section where they work with the babies but it is understandable that this is not possible...

It was interesting to see the moms and babies come out of the forest to eat. Seeing the babies alone was worth it. The center has a nice film about the plight of the Organutans. I never realized the devastation of the forests caused by all the palm oil planatations. Driving through that region of Borneo is sad because there are miles and miles of palm oil covered hills instead of natural vegetation. How terrible!

It is a one hour plane ride from KK then another 30 minute drive from the airport.  When you arrive you must lock your things in a locker as it is common for the monkeys at the park to steal your things so go in there with just the bare essentials.When you do enter you take a walk along the broadwalk to where they feed the orangutans.  You cant get up close and personal with them as it is a rehabilitation centre not a theme parkl.  The most you can do is sit on a seat and watch them eat.  There is no promise that they will appear as there are a number of feed platforms from which they are fed.  We were lucky enough to see a female with her baby feeding at the main platform but only for about 30 minutes after which they left for the jungle.  If you want good pictures you will need a camera with a good zoom.  There are other monkeys which feed at the platfrom as well.After that you can walk along the boardwalk until you come to the exit.  After which you can watch a short film in the theatre about the park and why is was created.

However, this worked okay for us.  The orang-utans are in the process of being rehabilitated and we understand the viewing deck is part of the process as well as a kind of necessary evil to help educate people and to raise awareness in Malaysia.  I still felt it was done quite tastefully with as much respect for nature as possible.  Also, we didn't mind the somewhat expensive entrance fee as it will help support the center's work.  We were touched by the loving bond between the orang-utan mothers and their babies and cherished every moment we got to see them.  One baby was only ten days old  and its mama was very protective of him but we still got glimpses which made us so happy.

Both experiences were busy, and didn't seem as natural as we had original expected.Whilst you do get to see these amazing creatures in their natural habitat, the great number of people around and the staged introduction of food to encourage the Orangutans to the platform does seem very zoo like.However if you are not planning a visit to Sandakan, the Sepilok sanctuary is an equally as enjoyable experience. The handlers are very well educated and informative and only too happy to answer questions.We had the opportunity to see a very young baby Orangutan and this was quite magical.The Sepilok sanctuary is set in a beautiful 5 star hotel - definately worth staying for a few days!"

We reached the Sanctuary by 2pm, and we paid RM5.00 each for me and my nanny, no ticket needed for my baby. After we bought the entrance tickets, we went to watch the vcr video and as usual baby won't stay long in the room. So we decided to go directly to see the orang utan. After the entrance, we walked throught a wooden path in the middle of the jungle and reaching a viewing platform in 20 minutes times. About 30 feets infront of the viewing platform where we were standing, we saw a tree and another smaller platform. On top of that platform, there were a mess with fruits skins or left over.The platform was so hot and stuffy with no wind. We waited and waited till 3pm. We sweated and uncomfortable.   At 3pm, 2 rangers came out and later on one mummy orang utan came out from a tree and a baby was on her back. The orang utan just do some tricks and the baby orang utan followed. After about 30 minutes, one of the guests standing beside me asked one ranger...is that it?? the ranger replied..yes... I made up my mind and left the sanctuary disappointed ... On the way out..my nanny kept grumping why do we need to come here..nothing to see..just 2 orang utan...and so hot"

The entrance ticket (30 ringits plus 10 for camera) was great value plus we were staying just round the corner we could use the ticket for both the 10am and 3pm feeding so went twice. The morning session we saw 2 orang-utans one of them with a baby and tons of other monkeys. In the afternoon we were walking to the viewing platform and a mother with baby clinging to her came out of the jungle right next to us and walked along the pathway just in front. Hugely lucky!! The afternoon feeding session had 6 in total and although there were less people had more children which the rangers had trouble keeping quiet. Definitely a must for any visit to Borneo

On top of the animals, there's a video room, souvenir shop, cafe, and a range of educational material on orangutans and the rehab centre. As we were leaving, there was one orangutan hanging about the reception area - being that close to it was simply amazing.We paid 40 ringgit to go from central Sandakan to the sanctuary with a brief stop at the Death March memorial.

When you get to the viewing platform, it kindda felt like a zoo.  We had hoped to walk around the sanctuary, but was disappointed to find all the walking trail was closed off.  Even though they stated you can made inquiry/reservation with the office, we didn't make the further attempt to do so.After most of the bus tours left, we went back around the entrance and got to the viewing platform the second time, with much less people around.  We did get a chance to watch the other monkeys that live in the sanctuary interact with the Orang-utan and how they took some of the left over food.  The iteration and display of nature's packing order was very interesting.  But as my boyfriend put it, this isn't all that different than what was available to see say in San Diego zoo.We did stay to watch the informational video, which is quite worth it.  As it shows the scope of the rehabilitation work that was done there.  It made us feel much better about being there and paying for the admission.For those that have never seen Orang-utan before this probably is a worthwhile experience, otherwise if you are planning on going to the river and catch a glimpse of the wile Orang-utan, you won't be missing much by not going here."

The Orang Hutan's at the sanctuary are either wild, or close to getting back to wild, so you can never be sure what you will see at any one viewing.  During our stay, as many as nine to as few as just one (a young one named Ronny that the rangers walked out to satisfy those there that afternoon) made an appearance at different viewings. For this reason, we booked and stayed three nights.  This was probably overkill - two nights is probably about right.  This allows several viewings at the sanctuary, as well as a look at the nearby rainforest info centre and the Labuk Bay Proboscis monkey sanctuary (we did the Kinabatangan and Gomantong separately - see our review of Myne Resort).If you are staying close by, ask the sanctuary staff about their RM20 per head one hour night walk (from 6pm).  This was just amazing. We saw several giant flying squirrels gliding from tree to tree, many snakes, scorpions and frogs. We even glimpsed a Slow Loris from the car park!  Watch out for Anne, one of the sanctuary's less wild Orang Hutan's.  She has a quirky sense of humour and may like to jump out at the end to try to scare you!   A taxi to/from Sandakan is RM40, or RM35 from the airport.Ummm, if you were silly enough to go walking into the jungle with open shoes then you could also expect to see some rather large leaches.

A short bus or taxi ride away from the town and you enter the rainforest. As the orangs are not in captivity, they are brought close to you by the twice a day feeding sessions. Only luck will determine how many orangs turn up to feed, so you might just see one, or you might see many more.We saw several and here is a very important tip: come for the day and not as part of a tour. In the morning the visitors on the tour could only stay for half an hour, but shortly after they had left a large troupe of macaque monkeys appeared, that hung around far longer than the orangs. We also encountered an orang very close up on the wooden walkway from the viewing area and two more very close up in the trees right next to the restaurant. Another good tip: Between the morning and afternoon feeding sessions, take a taxi down the road to the Rainforest Discovery Centre. There you can spend a pleasant few hours walking along some self-guided trails in the forest and high up amongst the trees on the canopy walkway, before returning to the Orang sanctuary for the afternoon feeding session. The sanctuary is doing excellent conservation work. It is well worth a visit."

I liked both for different reasons.Sepilok is set up more commercially than Semenggoh. Always remember that it is a Rehabilitation Centre, for Orang Utans and other animals. That is their focus, so they have better business plans. The feeding sessions are great, but it is worthwhile checking out the video session and information centre as well. They are really informative, even for 5yo. There are 2 feeding sessions - we had around 3 orang utans turn up for each. However, the morning session had more people, and monkeys visit as well. The afternoon had less people but less wildlife. A couple of extra points: It is really hot. Even if the weather is nice just outside Sepilok, the feeding platforms are really hot and muggy. Even guides from the area often comment about the heat within Sepilok. The entrance fee is more expensive than Semenggoh. This is probably because of facilities - there is a cafe at Sepilok, as well as the additional information services. Semenggoh doesn't have the same support. This gives Sepilok a more .... refined feel, for want of a better word. It is not a zoo - we are regular visitors of Taronga Zoo in Sydney, and Sepilok is definitely not a zoo even by those standards. The difference in fees is significant - Sepilok was RM75 for 2 adults + 1 kid; Semenggoh was RM6 and no camera fees. If you are staying locally, spend the extra cash and do a night walk (ask your reception). It is worth seeing Sepilok in both day and night."

We went to two feeding sessions and both times an alpha male came right up onto the fence of the viewing balcony - it seemed that he had perhaps been trained to do it.

Anyway, it's well priced to get in and with a nice cafe area and informative video show before hand, it makes for a very interesting place. My only concern was that I heard a low pitch tone just before feeding time and them wondering off again, so I genuinely hope this isn't some sort of Pavlovian response mechanism to teach the primates to ""come down"" for the tourists at specifically designated time.I fully understand the need for resources for the centre to aid the great work they do there, and the World needs a place where they can come and see this magnificent creatures, but I would be saddened if the tourist became the driving force behind what is a very worthwhile place doing great work to help a rare and endangered species.

Other practical stuff:When it's sunny, bring a good hat and sunscreen or you will toast at the viewing platform. Be aware, you can't take bags and stuff inside for safety measures, but that's a good thing to me. For camera's an additional fee is asked which I didn't find a problem.

In my experience, you either have a structured attraction where people get really close up with the wildlife or you have a completely open and free range attraction going right into the jungles and forests. This was a combination of both but not in an effective way. There is a single wooden trail to and fro a feeding platform where you may or may not see the orangutans at the supplementary feeding times. I personally think that if I'm going to spend my time and money on a mere chance of seeing the animals, I'd rather do it in a more 'organic' way by trekking through the jungle with a guide.

While you may see young Orang Utan and mothers come in for feeding, you won't see the orphan babies being rehabilitated.The feeding sessions are 'supplementary', meaning the animals are being encouraged to forage for their own food in the jungle, so there is no way of knowing how many animals will come in for a feeding.It often rains. Be prepared with at least an umbrella or single-use poncho.Go by all means, but remember this is not a theme park."

I know people who have travelled from England just to go there, and I have to say I would have been rather disappointed had I not been in Borneo for other purposes. I was expecting to stay for a whole day but after the 1 hour of feeding time there's really nothing else to see. The flim was well worth a watch in the visitors centre, but we left after a couple of hours. Another place that also gets you with the entrance fee and also extra fees for taking pictures."

Treks around the center : unlike what we read in Lonely Planet, we didn't see any trails to walk around the center. The path to observation platforms is build on a wooden boardwalk.Going there : we easily went there by public mini bus (2 MYR / person) from the center of Sandakan.

On arrival at the sanctuary we paid the charge for cameras (about 30RM) and then walked round the small but interesting information centre and then watched a documentary (in English) about the rehabilitation work of the sanctuary. At around 11am we walked out on the raised walkways (you don‚Äôt need special shoes as you walk on wooden boards so trainers should suffice) to the feeding area. We were very lucky to see about six beautiful Orang Utans. They are remarkable creatures and some seemed to enjoy playing up to their observers. After about 10 minutes a group of macaque monkeys descended onto the platforms to have their share of the food and frightened the Orang Utans off. Only two small Orang Utans remained but they had their arms round each other. Our guide told us that that the short tailed macaques are quite aggressive so the reaction of the Orang Utans was understandable! Although I agree with some posters that it can feels a little contrived but this is a rehabilitation centre and not the wild jungle. We were told that there are three feeding platforms stretching out through the sanctuary so as the Orang Utans become more confident they go further and further out and aren‚Äôt seen as much. The first platform is used by the younger and less confident Orang Utans.  When there is a lot of food available in the wild they are less likely to come to the feeding platform which may account for the reviews where people haven‚Äôt seen many or any. As another reviewer pointed out, this isn‚Äôt a zoo and although it would be incredibly disappointing to go such a long way and not see any, this is not the fault of the sanctuary. It does feel very hot there as you wait so prepare for the heat and sun."

Sadly due to continual deforestation and planting of palm oil trees all over Malaysia there and many other species are getting wiped out. This centre is nursing young and trying to keep the species from going extinct.  Upon  arrival and after paying 4 times the entrance fee as locals pay, you enter the centre which leads to an area where you can view the animals feeding. Check feeding times. Usually 1030 and 300pm.  It is really interesting to watch the monkeys , they say the're 97% human. And, orangutan means man of the forest in Malay.  A video presentation is also worth while watching. Expect to spend a couple of hours there. We hired a car on the first day but quickly  learnt it is much more worth while using taxis. Our taxi driver only charged us A$37 for the return trip from Sandakan and waited 1 1/2 hrs in the car park while we visited the centre. He also took us to the Australian memorial on the way back.  Much cheaper than a rental car at $60 per day , and then fuel, and trying to find your way around."

What I recommend: Do not follow the herd. Relax at the front by the lodge, walk slowly to the platform. The apes do not start coming into until right before 3:30. What are they doing before then? They are swinging in from the forest and if you are patient, you may catch one coming down from the trees and walking alongside of you all the way to the platforms to meet everyone else. Great program! WAtch the video to learn more about the work they do with the orphans. As a zoologist, I give this 5 stars!"

I can understand that some find it a disappointment to come all this way and not see any/many rangas, but after all, it is not a zoo, it is up to the animals whether they choose to come to the platforms to feed.  We were lucky as we saw two young ones before the platform, one was right next to the entrance building and ran off over the roof, and another a bit further along the path. Four females with babies came to the feeding platform, and another young one proceeded to follow the ranger back along the path after the session!  The only criticism i would have is that there should be more information on why there is a need for rehabilitation centres in the first place. I commend the centre for the effort it, and other centres are making towards rehabiliation, but the educational information could be a bit more clear on the reasons for deforestation, namely palm oil plantations. Maybe if visitors were aware that they themselves were indirectly contributing to  habitat destruction via products that contain palm oil, this might lead to more action to reduce deforestation. But maybe this is too sensitive an issue for an organisation that relies on the tourism dollar.  To make the most of your visit to Sepilok, also visit the Rainforest discovery centre about 1km up the road. Would also thoroughly recommend a river trip up the Kinabatangan river to see true wildlife. Also Sepilok nature resort right next to the sanctuary for accommodation."

This was followed by lots of tourists shouting ""stupid man!"" and other such comments.Beating the Orang Utans may be a common practice as none of the other employees batted an eye-lid, many of whom were carrying batton-like sticks.Shouldn't the employees of a centre that claims to be rehabilitating these inherently vunerable creatures be properly trained and setting a good example?"

The day we were there our guide said that there were only 8 in the vicinity of the first feeding platform (the only public one) and 2 had babies. We saw both mothers and babies and another 3 orangutans as well. As it is wild and not a zoo the ornangutans come and go as close as they please.

Now I understand that they are wild animals but when it is advertised constantly that you will see lots of orangutans it is rather disappointing...In the end we only saw one male and by then a lot of people had left, the platform is a good 20 meters away and not great for photos unless you have a mega zoom camera...the gift shop is another disappointment...I went in to get my son an orangutan toy, well there were none there..only over priced mugs and t'shirts...I will not go back there and do not recommend this place to anyone.

Not a single Monkey just Orangutans. Some of them were close by in the trees and you could get very close to them. When we finished we made our way back to the ticket office and spotted a few more along the way. Watched the video on the way out, I would suggest other people do that as well instead of watching it before you go to the feeding platform as you may be luckly like us and have them turn up early.We came back for the afternoon feed 3 days later, this time we were running late and turned up right on 3pm so we were one of the last to turn up, not so many tourists in the afternoon show and still 8 or 9 Orangutans. This time there were the cheeky monkeys others had spoken of challanging the Orangutans for the food, it was quite entertaining trying to see them get the better of one another.

If you are like me, you prefer to have things well organised rather than playing by ear when travelling with 3 young children.We chose to do a fly in fly out one day trip from KK to Sandakan. You can get very cheap flights and both KK and Sandakan airports are easy to negoiate. Sandakan itself seems a bit of a dump (but mind you we have only ever experienced Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia as Asian holidays so haven't seen how ""dumpy"" we know Asia can get).We hired a taxi for the cost of 120 ringgit from the airport. There was a taxi rank manager at the airport who directed us to the next available taxi, so it was all very orderly and no-one in our face chasing our business like we experienced in KL.  Although we had 5 passengers (including 3 children)  it wasn't too uncomfortable to drive around because Sepilok is only about 20 minutes from the airport.We went to the morning feeding session and only saw one mother with baby. However, they walked along the handrail all the way to the feeding station which was breathtaking. The mother stopped twice to bare it's teeth and reach out at our 5 year old - I'm not sure why she didn't like him!We heard the ranger say they generally get more orangutans in the afternoon, but the cynic in me thinks they probably say the opposite to the afternoon guests. If you are staying in Sandakan/Sepilok I'd suggest going to both morning and afternoon sessions as it's very cheap in Aussie dollar terms.We also visited the Rainforest Discovery Centre a few minutes drive from Sepilok and the War Memorial before returning to the airport.Please feel free to send us a note if you need more information - especially about travelling with 3 young children (ours were 11, 8 & 5)."

While this is NOT a zoo, it is indeed a rehabilitation center for orangutans who have lost their parents or were found in captivity. The infants are trained here to live in the wild and eventually nurtured to be released back to the wild. Sometimes they may appear during the allocated feeding times while there is no guarantee on seeing them. In most cases, you will see a few of them. There is a walk through of what happens here at the sanctuary - http://blog.malaysia-asia.my/2009/12/sepilok-orang-utan-sanctuary-in-sabah.html So when you visit this place, make sure you ask the tour guide or call the center to find out if they orangutans are showing or now.

Sadly they toddled out a little orangutan who sat on the platform clearly not wanting to be there! They'd walked it up the path holding hands when no others fronted. Clearly some people demand at least some sighting. Not exactly the natural experience we were hoping for!We returned in the afternoon on the same ticket, luckily. Alas just one lovely mother and her baby whom i also suspect was dropped off there moments before. She ate for a while and was lovely to see. The monkeys were there en masse. It was all fun for a while but once the show is over they swarm to where the people are. Lining the path of your departure. Make no mistake, they are not friendly little critters! They are looking for things to grab from you, food and water especially. If you make eye contact they become aggressive and at some points scared the poop out of some people. They are an issue that needs to be sorted out!!!Conversely, the day prior we had been to Semenggoh in Sarawak, just outside Kuching. That was wonderful. Much more natural, low key, fewer people and a more natural environment clearly designed for the wildlife, not the tourists. We paid a tiny sum for 5 people and were treated to a dozen or more beautiful Orangutans who lingered and ate, played and climbed around us in the trees. It was magnificent!When leaving a mother and baby were the final bonus, only a few meters from the path and a joy to watch.To be honest, prior to travel I thought the exact opposite more likely and was going to Semenggoh as a backup to Sepilok. The reverse was true. Sepilok was average and Sandakan itself was very, very ordinary!!!Be aware of course, every day is different! I am sure in any given week one is spectacular whilst the other is abandoned and vice versa. At the heart of each of these places is the desire for the Orangutans to be free in the wild and indeed not need to be fed at all - If you see them it's a bonus but allow a couple of days and multiple visits if you want to be certain of seeing these truly beautiful animals!"

I could go on we seen more on the Kota Kinabatangan river....  with the amount of palm trees that are being planted in Malaysia there wont be a lovely jungle there forever, so experience this while you can!!"

We managed to see around 5 during feeding time, but we hear that some people didn't manage to see any, or saw only 1 or 2. Good to learn about the orangutan and what the palm oil industry is doing to the area. They have a mini museum that you can walk around and learn about orangutan, and they also show you a movie on the work that they do.It would be nice if this was coupled with a rainforest preservation program as the potential sites for relocation of orangutan are decreasing rapidly due to land clearing for oil palm plantations"

We were a little disappointed not to see more, but as has been stated previously, this is not a zoo, the animals are there for rehabilitation and eventual release into the wild, not for the enjoyment of camera snapping tourists.  We were happy just to have been there and to have supported the centres efforts to help these magnificant animals."

Yes it cost me RM30 plus RM10 for my camera but it was worth every sen. I went to the afternoon feeding and when I was walking to the feeding site, alone, I saw a flash of orange in the trees. I took many photos but without a flash, and there turned out to be three orangutans. They started coming closer and closer to have a look at me (I was starting to wonder who was in the zoo) and one came right up, sat on the railing next to me, and showed off her baby. I was arm's length away. The other two came close too, and both had babies also. A minute or two later a tour group came by but the orangutans didn't like the camera flashes and went away after a short time. Once we got to the actual feeding site there were two of these mothers and babies and right at the end a male turned up. He was bigger than the others (but not one of the huge males) and posed on the railing before heading to the platform. So - it's the luck of the draw, you can be lucky but maximise your chances by being very quiet and not using a camera flash. We also did a night jungle walk here (just ask at reception). It was very good, there were all sorts of critters like flying squirrels, a snake, spiders, scorpions and even a crab. If you do this, take your own torch as they do not provide them. It's all walking on the boardwalk so no fear of leeches etc. As for the site being a rip-off - there is nothing else to do in Sepilok at all, it's four or five hotels and a sanctuary. If you go in the morning there is no extra charge for going to the afternoon feed. It's a sanctuary with rehabilitated animals and the money goes towards amazing work for animals who are highly threatened by the world's desire for palm oil. If you want to see something guaranteed, go to a zoo. If you want the chance of a natural encounter with a beautiful animal without cages in between, come here."

Just ask anyone who's been on safari. When we visited Sepilok we knew that there was always a risk the Orangutans wouldn't show up, to think any different would be naive.After getting advice from the amazingly helpful lady in the Sandakan tourist information, she helped us book our trip with Mr Lai from Winho Lodge in Sandakan. We arranged to visit Sepilok for the 1500 feeding and then go onto Labuk Bay. Mr Lai picked us up from our hotel and drove us out to Sepilok, stopping briefly at the war memorial. He was a world of information and spoke very good english. At Sepilok Mr Lai arranged our tickets and showed us first to the museum and then to the video presentation. These were both very moving and informative but one minor critisism is that they need bringing into the 21st century as it appears nothing has changed here in 20 years. This however serves as a reminder that Sepilok is 95% conservation project and 5% tourist attraction. Afterwards we made our way to the viewing platform where one orangutan with a baby and a host of macaque monkeys were already present. As feeding time started more and more orangutan began to show up including several large males and even a very young male. The workers laid out food for the orangutan and the males of the group kept the very active macaque monkeys at bay. All of these orangutan have a connection with the sanctuary in one way or another and are free to come and get food or not. They were not made to perform for the tourists and even sat with their backs to us while eating. After 20/30 minutes they began to make their way back into the jungle and back to their solitary lives. When only the constantly hungry macaque monkeys were left, we made our way through the jungle to the exit. We passed the gift shop and were surprised at how small and tucked away it was ..... reminding us that Sepilok is first and foremost a Sanctuary.All in all we had a superb experience, but this was purely because we got to see these wonderful apes in their natural habitat. I can understand the frustration of those who were unlucky not to see the monkeys ..... but that's the risk you take. I hope Sepilok continues to do its wonderful work and save countless more orangutan before we humans wipe them out."

Three visits, all stunning, all different.We saw several lone young orang-utans and three adult females with young all about 1 month old. I understand why you cant go into the orphanage as they want to keep human contact to a minimum and then get them back in the jungle where they belong.

We had already visited an Orang Utan wildlife centre at Semengok near Kuching where amid, silence and respect for the animals, we were told all about the residents, their history and the names/characteristics of those who came to feed. Sepilok was, we hoped , going to be the same, if not better. But, oh dear, what a contrast. The biggest disappointment of the whole holiday. Limited opening hours with the feeding times slap in the middle of the am/pm feeds meant little time to see anything else. Not that there was much else to see. A video which we had already seen on tv in the Uk and a living room sized area with 'information'. Not a single warden in sight to tell anyone about what was being done at the centre. We went to the pm feeding centre. Before going through to the boardwalk everyone has to hand in their bottles of water as a precaution. We stood around then for over 30 mins in the very hot sun, no shade and no water. 4 OUs arrived before feeding time started, it must have been the noise from the unruly crowd that alerted them. Two 'wardens' then threw two buckets of fruit onto the feeding platform, much of which went behind a tree so that no-one could see the OUs anyway 15 mins later it was all over and the OUs had gone back out of earshot of the crowd (lucky them). No other animals to see at sepilok at all.If you are going to Sepilok hoping to see lots of cute baby OUs in wheelbarrows with nappies on, forget it. I can understand that they do not want tourists marching through that area, but as the world's most renowned and respected OU rehabilitation centre I would have thought that they could have shown more interest in informing the general public what is happening currently. Some of the 'latest' orphan update pages were dated 2006. Dreadful PR.  Fortunately we went from disappointing Sepilok to Seligan Island Turtle Reserve. Brilliant!  Definitely the highlight of our trip."

It was so disappointing - there were 3 Orang utans yet hundreds of people - worse than a zoo.  The movie was worthwhile as it shows what they do and the centre clearly does good things and good work, but there is no point in tourists visiting the site.  They charge money to see orang utans really far away.  The Labuk sanctury that has the proboscis monkeys was 1000 times better - there were two different platforms with so many monkeys in a natural environment and not many people relatively.  The rainforest discovery centre is also definately worthwhile, but I would skip the orang utans unless you happen to be there - I certainly wouldn't travel from long distances to see it.  There are enough other attractions near sandakan area."

The day we visited we were told that no orang-utans came out in the morning, so we were lucky to get three in the afternoon. They did all their tricks and ate bananas from the handlers while we took photos. While they were out it was a pleasure to watch, but the catch is that the tours all arrive about 2pm and the feeding time isn't until 3pm - so it's a long wait in the intense heat and humidity.

An orangutan and his buddy come swinging up to the platform via rope to slurp up some yummy milk and peel some nanas.  Cameras are clicking away... and then, they're gone.  All those high hopes and only a few minutes of action.  We stuck around for another 30 minutes hoping they'd decide to come back for a little snack, but to no avail.Apparently there are hiking trails around the park that we did not discover until someone told us about them (by this time we could not check them out).  The couple who told us said they saw many orangutans on the trails.  They also got found by 2 leeches.  Sharing stories later on with other travelers revealed similar stories about the actual number of orangs that come to the feedings.  One couple saw only 1... but another saw only 2 at the feeding but returned later on to find one chill-axin' on the platform.  Unfortunately it's all a matter of luck and the moods of the animals.  This place is quite pricey to experience if you're only going to see 1 ape, but to keep it in perspective, you're making a donation to the conservation efforts.If you're planning to do some jungle trekking or river cruises I'd give this a miss.

The idea for the Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre at Sepilok was conceived in 1961 and by 1964 was a reality funded by the Sabah Government. The reserve is named after the two rivers flowing into Sandakan Bay.When we arrived on the platform we were told an aggressive male orangutan had wandered into the feeding area and baby and toddler orangs were being kept safe in the nursery.However we were soon joined by a young male who had managed to escape .He was quickly gathered up and returned to the nursery but not before he had his photo shoot.We did enjoy watching the antics of the few older orangutans who made it to the feeding platform.We are not skilled with the camera but have very much  enjoyed our pictures since we came home.After lunch we moved to the Rain Forest Discovery Centre and headed for the Plant Discover Centre. We are both enthusiastic about plants and our garden  and this plant centre was wonderful.We especially like the pitcher plants and the orchids are so beautiful. Is very hard to know when to stop taking pictures. It is all very natural but is obviously very lovingly tended by the gardeners.We enjoyed watching them working.We returned to our lodge and then in the early evening we drove to Sandakan  town to meet some friends at the roof terrace bar of the Nak Hotel.The town was so busy as it was nearly the end of Ramadan and the pavements were crowded with market stalls.We wished we had had time to see more of it.

It is not commonly advertised, even by tourist information offices, but there is a mini bus service which will take you to the entrance of the Sanctuary.  It will arrive in time for the morning feeding, but does not leave Sepilok on a regular basis, so you will need to ask the driver when the next bus returns to Sandakan.  Also I would advise that you wait around after the feeding of the orang utans, as there are macaques come in for the leftovers at the platform.  We hung around until told we had to leave by the ranger, and on the way back along the boardwalk there was an orang utan coming towards us walking along the railing.

However our day trip took us then onto a boat that went up a river and there we were able to spot monkeys in the wild and other wild life which was much more like we had imagined.

I would also hazard to guess that a viewing gallery of 200 peple madly clicking away at the orangutans in clear daylight will hardly help them re-adjust to life in the wild!I would hope the centre could do a bit more to bring the whole rehabilitation journey to life, rather than just keep re-running a 30 minute dated video on the centre. I fully understand that this is a sanctuary and not a zoo, but there must be a way of providing a better experience for both ape and visitor!We also went to Rasa Ria, which gave access to their younger apes, which from a visitor perspective was much more rewarding as they are not fully released back into the wild, there are less people and it is a shaded viewing platform (which makes a big difference!)Overall, it was one of the least impressive chapters in our holiday but unfortunately the sanctuary relies on high turnover of visitors to fund the centre."

Go through to the viewing platform straight-away and wait for almost an hour (dont worry about missing the video, you can watch that afterwards). You may be entertained by smaller monkeys whilst you wait for the 3pm orangutan feeding. If you don't do this, you will be at the back of the crowd and see very little of the orangutans. We went twice and only two orangutans showed. I know they don't guarantee any particular numbers (in fact we were told that on rare occasions no orangutans turn up to a feeding) but having been to the equivalent sanctuary in Sumatra at Bukit Lawang some years ago, I would say that Sumatra is much better than Sepilok. Sepilok packs in too many people to a feeding session and the whole atmosphere is noisy and commercial. Had I travelled from KK specially for this on a day-trip excursion, I would have been even more disappointed with the experience. If you are including Kuching in you trip around Borneo, then you may wish to consider seeing orangutans at the Semmengoh sanctuary instead, which is a bit (although admittedly not a huge amount) better."

The morning feed at 11am tends to be very busy with bus loads of tourists turning up. Expect well over 100 pax, many of them excitable children, creating a zoo show-like atmosphere. The centre needs this income, so the feed session starts on time and follows quite a strict schedule to allow the tours to each function properly. The afternoon feed sessions, however, can be less busy, since the tour busses, I think, favour the morning slot and they cannot wait around for the afternoon session as well.In my experience (in Sepilok for about 5 days) i would suggest spending at least a couple of days in the area if possible, so you can be on site when you choose, that is before and after the main feeding events. Often the Orangs do 'hang around' after the main tour crowds have been ushered away and I got some fab photos thru having enough time onsite and by being patient. Also, staff respond well to the calm, responsible visitors and we were able to ask questions after the crowds had gone, to get a little better understanding of the apes and the centre. The staff are extremely helpful, informative and they will allow you to linger a little beyond to normal times if conditions allow."

The Wildlife Expeditions rep‚Äô was on time, and transfer to Sepilok went well.  We arrived just after 10am, in good time for the 11am feeding.  We had to pay extra for cameras at the desk.  The tour guide took us to the feeding platform, a lovely short walk thorough the lowland rainforest jungle.  Up to this point it was great.Sadly, now our disappointment starts.  We arrived at the feeding platform viewing area, it was very big.  The feeding station was about 10m or so away from nearest part of the viewing area.  Whilst we waited more people arrived, and at 11am there must have been at least 150 other people there, and there was still plenty of room for more ‚Äì would not have like to have been there when it‚Äôs full.  Even when we had all been asked to turn off mobile / cell phones there was at least 2 nationalities that thought the rule did not apply.  Sadly the view over the small feeding station very limited and you had to elbow to get the best photo shots.  Thank goodness for good cameras with good lenses!At 11am the wardens / keepers walked out to the feeding platform and sat there with a small pile of food.  A little while later one of the ropes started to move, a tale tail sign an orang was on the way, and swung over the to the feeding platform, as the wardens / keepers put a ‚Äòsilence‚Äô sign on the tree, and the ape then sat down with its back to the viewing platform and started to eat.  It was rather comical.A few minutes later a mum and tiny baby appeared, then another 2, and then finally 1 more of these beautiful creatures came to the feeding station.  The wardens / keepers stayed on the feeding platform for most of the time.  All the time you could here click, click, click, click of the cameras.  After about 20 minutes the wardens / keepers clear up and go, the hint that we have to make a move and go also.  The gates are closed at 12 noon until 2pm before the next feeding at 3pm, which is much more quiet and has far less visitors.  Yes it was wonderful to see the orang-utans as I had always wanted to see them, but it did feel staged, and almost a performance.  It was expensive and a long trip to see them for just 15-30 minutes or so.  We were lucky, we spoke to some others who only saw 2 orang-utans.  Like many I thought this was going to be the ‚ÄòWOW‚Äô moment of our holiday and so wanted to really enjoy it, and sad did not.  I actually came away feeling disappointed about the experience, and wish we had gone to see them at the Rasa Ria and saved time and money.  We did not come away from the experiance with anything we would have not got from a good zoo.I do believe the sanctuary is doing a fabulous job and needs continuing support to ensure these beautiful creatures do not become extinct, and should be totally commended for the work in rehabilitating our nearest cousins.   Balancing wildlife with tourist is always difficult I guess.The highlight for us would have to be whilst we were walking back to the bus, just the 2 of us as not with the main group and saw a solitary orang resting in the trees.  We watched it for a while, and as more folks appeared on the walk way, slowly climbed down the tree and disappeared.If we went again, we would plan to stay overnight at the Sepilok Jungle Resort, Sepilok Forest Edge Resort, Sepilok Nature Resort, and go the sanctuary for the afternoon feeding session which is far less busy with tours or just stay at the Shangri-la Rasa Ria and visit the sanctuary there."
1.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 28 December 2008,,The setup of the Orang-utan feeding is quite simple: They have a huge platform for the tourists (capacity 600 pax) and a small platform 10 metres away from it to feed the monkeys. It was not even easy to take pictures of the monkeys because they were so far away. I believe there are far better ways to experience and see monkeys than this.Its not worth the 30 minute car ride from Sandakan and absurb to come here  from Kota Kinabalu. Generally the Sanctuary are doing proper work and rely on donations - so it is ok that the price to see the feeding is so expensive. But for the 3 minute feedin ''show'' you better do a 3 day djungle trekking instead.
1.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 23 December 2008,,"I stayed there last week & I must say this has been one of my worst experiences at a resort ever. I normally don't write reviews but felt I ought to warn people so they don't make the mistake of staying there.From the moment we checked-in, they tried ripping us off by trying to sign us up for these over-priced tours. For example, a ""guided"" walk to the Orangutan sanctuary nextdoor for $45 (which you can basically do on your own). The tour lady at the resort was persistent to sell this, till she managed to annoy us.The room was basic. They call it a luxury resort & we had to request for even things like towels, soap etc. We were served a breakfast the first day which was a plate of dried sausages & an egg. Only realised later on they charged us $30 for each! Upon checking-out, they also added in some beers on the bill which we didn't consume.But what topped it all was that we found out the owner of this resort regularly throws late-night parties at the resort. So we had a big crowd of people making a noise, loud music & blaring speakers all night. This at a ""nature"" resort where you expect peace & quiet. When we spoke to the manager about this, he just shrugged & walked off without an answer.  All in all, a very negative experience which totally ruined my trip. Later on heard that a few of the other resorts nearby are much better & even nicer."

We arrived for the morning feed which was far too crowded (two coaches from a cruise ship arrived) and not helped by the fact we were unlucky to get caught in a torrential down pour. So much so it was beginning to look like no Orang Utans were going to show up (the macacs decided to take shelter instead). In the end about 6 arrived at the platform which is about 30 ft away. After about 15mins we had to start making tracks via the gift shop (think Next first day of sale!!)....then back on the bus.I posted a tip about locals using the word dollar when referring to ringits...and in the gift shop here they were blatantly taking US dollars from the crusie ship people (i.e. saying 10 dollars when the price was 10 RM). Ripping people off.We were really just all hearded  to the feeding station and hearded out again, I would have expected a more comprehensive tour of the facility...something more about how they rehabilitate and to see what they do. I thought this was to be the highlight of my tour but it was such an anticlimax"

I really liked the pay TV it was great to be able to relax at night and watch a movie. Sure there may not be toiletries in the bathroom, but does it really matter?? This place is about being close to nature  it  has an abundance of wildlife and amazing sounds of nature can be heard never far off. The staff where attentative, and always willing to assist, there English speaking skills helped us to communicate effectively with another.The Orang Utan sanctuary was very close all but a few minutes walking distance from the resort. There where walks to go on, a lovely orchid garden, other travellers to talk to and delicious BBQ buffet dinners. Planning on taking the rest of my family- hospitality and location will be missed!!"
3.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 4 September 2008,,"We have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Sepilok Nature Resort.We stayed in Chalet 14 which overlooked the lake, the room was clean and bug free, it did get really hot but all we did was remove the key from the aircon tag and left the aircon on when we left the room. Food was OK nothing special the buffet had plenty of choice and was kept hot.The resort was perfect for the sanctuary as its a 2 minute walk turning right when you leave the resort entrance.Tips for the sanctuary would be - arrive early before the main crowds (ticket allows entry to both the morning and afternoon session) the afternoon session was considerably less busy than the morning, take water but keep it in your bag, take a sunhat and plenty of sun tan lotion it is really hot. We also didn't realise that once you have brought your ticket you can go off and walk around the sanctuary jungle we were really disappointed that this wasn't made clearer at the time.We also went to see the Gotmong Caves - this was probably the highlight of our trip as we were lucky to visit when they were collecting the swift nests for Birds Nest soup and on the way back we stopped off at the Proboscis Monkey Sanctuary.Overall a good stay although I did feel that we actually saw more 'wildlife' when we stayed at the Datai in Langkawi then on our whole trip to Borneo. Perhaps we were just unlucky."
2.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 18 August 2008,,"Not  worth a big detour or special day out.Feeding times are very busy with huge numbers of people and  it's difficult to get a decent view. Even if you do, all we saw was a couple of young orang utans sitting on a wooden platform with a couple of their keepers. The viewing experience was really very little different from that in an open plan, well planted enclosure in a zoo .If you're passing, by all means pop in but otherwise don't feel you've missed out."
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 19 June 2008,,"We stayed at Sepilok Nature Resort for two nights 8th & 9th June 2008 as the second leg of our Borneo adventure.  I had expected the room to be very basic but I was pleasantly surprised, it was a large wooden cabin on stilts overlooking a huge lake and boarded walkways with the jungle on the far side of the lake, butterflies and birds were everywhere.  The cabin contained a huge wooden four poster bed, wardrobe, fridge, tea and coffee making facilities, television and an en-suite large bathroom with a grey stone bath sunken into the floor.  Everything was very clean and we had a fairly large balcony.  The food was average, nothing really fantastic but we didn't starve the first night was a buffet as there were several people staying but the next day we got a set menu for lunch and dinner as there were only three couples staying.  For breakfast there was the usual cereal, fruit, hot buffet or you could have eggs cooked freshly.We went on an early morning and a night jungle walk both of which were amazing and we saw a variety of birds, snakes, insects and a slow Loris.  We were lucky enough on the first evening to see two flying squirrels thanks to our wonderful guide Miki.  We went to see the orang utan feeding twice in the morning and evening and got some brilliant pictures and video.  I would advise anyone going to make sure you actually get to the feeding platform at least 30 minutes before they start to get a good place as there are lots of people there.  If you are staying at the resort and intend to do the jungle walks make sure you have long trousers tucked into thick socks and boots, long sleeves and preferably a hat.  Even so, my husband managed to find a leech up his sleeve greedily feeding on him (yuk)  (he was quite chuffed though).  We wanted to experience the real Borneo as well as having our luxury time at a couple of hotels (see reviews for Nexus & Rasa Ria) and this certainly enhanced our trip, the apes were fantastic and we adopted a baby called Sen.  We went on from here to a village called Bilit but that is in a separate Review."
1.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 25 May 2008,,"Hmmm....where should I start with  my review..? To begin with, I booked the hotel directly via email. Whilst we weren't going to be arriving for another three (3) weeks, they insisted that we pay up front (not particularly unreasonable I guess, but no other hotels in Malaysia had the same rules) and tried to onsell overpriced tours, which we declined. On arrival at the hotel, they insisted that I had booked just the single room (hardly, since I was travelling with my partner) and tried to take payment again. Luckily I had printed a copy of the emails confirming they had taken the payment, which I had to show them as they didn't seem to believe that I was telling the truth! Even then, they said they would need to double check and get back to me. We were then given our double (as requested in my email), and I must say our room was very basic and overpriced. We paid the equivalent of AUD100 for a very simple room with inadequate lighting (we had to squint to find anything) and very basic bathroom with no toiletries to speak of. Both times that we spoke to reception to organise a taxi, the prices they quoted were double the going rate of a taxi, so we didn't use that complimentary (!!) facility. We were also woken up at 7.15am by the hotel staff, banging away at the planks on the decking outside our room - completely inconsiderate. And the breakfast....my goodness, it was seriously atrocious! Inedible cold food (if you could call it that) that you should avoid at all costs. The brown muck that was supposed to be coffee and tea was literally brown muck - disgusting! I normally don't write such negative reviews but I just had to warn people about this hotel. On the plus side, the grounds are lovely, and you are a stones throw away from the gorgeous orangutans."
1.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 26 January 2008,,Don't stay here.  Loved Borneo - hated this place. Still annoys me to think of how it gave such a bad inital impression of Borneo.The orangutan place is great this place isnt. They are completey different places un attached to one another. This hotel tries to live off the reputation of the wildlife centre unjustly. Freezing food and terrible terrible service and un helpful staff. Rooms are poor.They will try and sell you a package for this and that basically they are out to get as much money out of you as possible. We booked on a turtle trip and they changed the day and when we said we couldnt go this day they refused to give us any money back - they still owe us ¬£250.Watch them they will be very nice before you get there offering pick ups from airport etc then when you are there they wont even give you numbers for taxis - because you ar a little isolated they want you to pay through the nose for their transport and terrible services.There is a bus from not far from the resort to Kota Kinabalu and taxis are availbale from orangutan centre so don't let the resort bully you into paying them for services.Wanted to let everyone know the place is worth avoiding we saw people shouting and even a couple of people crying arguing with staff - and then next day it was us!!! Be vey careful - pay for nothing up front - dont get charged for the cold buffet and if possible stay somewhere else - Jungle Resort is much better much friendlier and helpful staff.
4.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 16 January 2008,,"We spent two nights at Sepilok Nature Resort as part of our three week trip over Christmas and New Year.  Borneo is an amazing place; so green and verdant, despite the ubiquitous palm oil plantations.Sepilok Nature Resort is a wonderfully manicured place.  It is in the jungle but it is very much tamed and nurtured to provide an incredible experience.  It isn't fake at all, just very tidy and well-cared for.  The rooms - chalets - are neat, tidy, clean and well equipped.  They are beautifully situated amongst the trees and walkways that wind their way round the lakes and ponds that resort is built around.  It really is a stunning piece of nature.The rooms are all as one would expect.  Air-con, fridge, power, fans, en-suite bathrooms with hand-held shower.  They all have verandahs or balconys on which to sit with a drink and watch the birds.The public areas are comfortable and the staff look after you well enough.  The food lacks imagination and was a little too Chinese for our liking; we really hadn't appreciated how Chinese the food in Malaysia would be, it is much less like Thai than we thought.  That said it was perfectly edible but you're really not there for the food.  You only stay at Sepilok for one reason - the orang utans.And weren't they just a priviledge!  There are two feeding sessions every day and it is literally a 5 minute walk from the resort to the reserve.  In fact our chalet backed onto the forest that the orangs live in.  It may appear like a bit of a circus but you need to remember that the orangs don't have to come to be fed, it's a supplement to their diet and not the only diet they have.  But to see them at such close quarters is one of those experiences that stay with you for life.The morning feed is much busier as the buses bring people on their day trips from KK.  As a result we were amongst a group of around 60 people at 10am watching a group of around 12 orangs and plenty of macaques.  The afternoon session was much quieter.  Perhaps only 20 people or less watching around 6 apes.  You really feel that you are in their domain and that they are in charge.  Incredible!I gather that the Nature Resort is being renovated this month and that it will involve an expansion to the restaurant area.  It is overdue and I hope that it will include a bar!  At the time we were there we had to pop over the road to the Jungle Resort to buy a few tins to have a beer before dinner and a sundowner outside the chalet.  But it's a Muslim country so one can't expect Western standards all the time.But it is a good resort that is quite beautiful to stay in.  If it had the bar and a bit more life about it then it would be superb.  At the time we stayed there they can't have had more than about a dozen guests and it felt very quiet as a result.  That was quite nice!"
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 7 January 2008,,"The primary purpose of my visit to Borneo was to visit Sepilok to see first-hand how orphaned baby orangutans are rehabilitated for the wild. It was fabulous to watch their little determined faces as they inched forward along the ropes from the nursery to the feeding platform and also to watch mothers swing in with their babies clinging to their fur. You learn a lot about the orangutan's temperament just watching them at the platform: just how placid they are even when cheeky macaques swarm over the platform trying to pinch their food, how sociable they are when they are in each other's company and how desperately the smaller ones cling to each other, still seeking a comforting cuddle.Sepilok is also considered by the Sabah Wildlife Department to be a way in which to educate visitors about the orangutan but, as the education must not interfere with the rehabilitation, visitors are restricted to walkways and are not allowed to approach or handle the apes. However, the older ones may sneak up behind you on the viewing platform as they make their own way to the feeding platform. You are by no means seeing a fully wild orangutan here but, considering how their natural habitat is rapidly disappearing, it would be a rare treat to see one in the wild. And where else would you see so many of the fuzzy red cuties interacting together?"

Food was good for Malaysia I appreciate the comments but variety is not the norm here and food is often served cold but that is the norm for all malasia. The sepilok santuary is not to be missed,  but if you get a chance and have the time try to follow through with Sukau 'up the jungle' where you will get a chance to see Orang utans in the wild also."
5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 31 July 2007,,"Just to make it clear, we stayed at Sepilok Nature Resort, which is right next door to the Sepilok Orangutan Sanctuary and separate from the Sepilok Jungle Resort, which is over the road.  The resort location is just unbeatable, if you want a relaxing start to the holiday (we had just had a days travel and jetlag from the UK).  The jetlag also helped, as it meant we were awake early each morning and could get the most out of the place - an early start is the best to sit on your terrace, with a cup of borneo tea, look (and listen!) to the nature.  It's so quiet and yet so loud!  The accomodation was excellent, each chalet is detached and number 14, which we were in looked out directly over the lake and onto virgin rainforest of the reserve (I think it had the best view of all chalets, with no13).  The service was excellent (like everywhere in malaysia, always with a smile) and everyone was very helpful.  The food was good, but don't expect anything of gourmet quality, the meals were buffet and a mix of malay, chinese and some western-inspired food.  The chalet accomodation, service and location deserve to give the resort a 4/5-star, with food letting it down from that standard (just due to limited range, not quality).We took 3 trips, the first, to the orangutan sanctuary was the obvious reason to go, but you don't need a guide - its literally out the door turn right and your there, the guide was very nice and pointed out lots of things, but it wasn't necessary.  The second trip was a night jungle walk, which was amazing and took about 1 hour and a bit, walking through a bit of rainforest in the grounds with a guide - it had rained loads during the day, so lots of leeches about - not nice, but a chance to walk through the jungle at night with all the noise and animals was brilliant.  The third was to the Labuk bay Proboscis monkey sanctuary, which was excellent as well - it's essentially a money-making venture by the land-owners who were going to transform the swamp into palm-oil plantation, but realised they could make money keeping the swamp and attracting the groups of monkeys with food!  This sounds awful, but it wasn't and it was worth it just for the trip to get there!I would definitely recommend the nature resort, although I don't know what the jungle resort is like, it seemed a bit less refined!"
3.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 21 May 2007,,"What a strange place! Firslty seeing the 'tangs is amazing, not even a question but the hotel itself is somewhat lacking. The rooms and setting are just gorgeous but the service is well absent.There is no information about what is around and what is going on and the staff know nothing about the tours that are available, they just point to the notice board with the name of the tour and the prices. They all speak very good English and smile but they don't know anything or at least aren't forthcoming. I get the impression that it is set up for people who are already booked onto tours when they get there. There is no info pack in the room or in reception. They couldn't even point us to the orchid garden in the hotel grounds, very odd. Things like this aren't hard to do but they are the difference between a pleasant stay and a frustrating one! The food is awful, even the orange juice is watered down at breakfast. The location is stunning though."

5.0 of 5 bubbles,Written 29 July 2005,,"Visiting Sepilok Orang Utan Sanctuary was one of the best highlights of my gap year around the world. The centre does an excellent job of rehabilitating orphaned Orang Utan's and returning them to the wild. Without places like Sepilok these amazing animals would be lost from our planet forever.A wooden walkway takes you through some of Sabah's most beautiful rainforests to the feeding station in the heart of the sanctuary. We were advised not to expect to see many, if not any, Orang Utans coming back to feed.  Twice a day food is put out for the Orang Utans to suppliment their wild diets. We were thrilled when the trees started to rustle and three fully grown females swung in. They were closely followed by five more, including some smaller, 'teenage' Orang Utangs.One particular male stopped to give us a cheeky show of tricks before heading for the platform to feed. They are fasinating creatures to observe. We were so lucky to see ten in total that afternoon.The guides from Borneo Adventures were excellent and gave us a full history of the centre and it's special guests.Any trip to Sabah would not be complete without a visit here. Highly recommended."
