## Background Overview

Malaysia will be showcasing its sustainable and ecotourism offerings at Fitur 2023, with a focus on the state of Sabah as the prime representative of ecotourism in the country. The Malaysian Tourism Promotion Board, along with Dato' Akmal Che Mustafa, the Ambassador of Malaysia in Spain, and Ms Noredah Othman, CEO of Sabah Tourism, will present Malaysia's nature tourism, sustainable tourism, and slow travel options. Sabah, renowned for its tropical forests, coral reefs, and Mount Kinabalu, aims to provide an authentic ecotourism experience. Malaysia's National Ecotourism Plan emphasizes the protection, preservation, and conservation of nature, culture, and heritage, promoting respectful interactions between visitors and local communities. The country offers various ecotourism destinations, including Sepilok Orangutan Sanctuary, Mulu National Park, Belum Rainforest Resort, and Rantau Abang Turtle Hatchery, all recognized for their conservation efforts. With its rich biodiversity, Malaysia provides a captivating blend of tradition, nature, and delicious cuisine, making it a must-visit destination for Spanish travelers seeking a unique experience in Southeast Asia.
